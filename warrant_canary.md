I warrant that the [OpenSSL
Foundation](https://openssl-foundation.org/) is effectively pursuing
[its mission](https://openssl-mission.org/):

> We believe everyone should have access to security and privacy
> tools, whoever they are, wherever they are or whatever their
> personal beliefs are, as a fundamental human right.
