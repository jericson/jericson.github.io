    <h1>Web Publishing for Fun and Profit</h1>

    <h2>For Fun</h2>
    <p>
      Some things people do are pointless unless the person doing them
      thinks they are fun&mdash;publishing a web page for instance.
      There are plenty of things that we should do even if they are
      unpleasant, such as pay taxes, give food to the poor, and wash
      behind our ears.  But if you feel some sort of obligation to
      update your web page, you're doing it wrong.
