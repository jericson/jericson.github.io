    </p>
    <p>
      I have made it through another week!  This weekend is going to
      be really busy, so you´re getting your update early.  I´m not
      sure if the one from last week got sent, so I´ll send it again
      after I finish this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday: The afternoon after I sent my last update, we went our
      to tell people about Jesus and about 10 people decided that they
      wanted to ask Him to be their Lord and Saviour, including a
      Japanese tourist!  That night, we went out to eat with some of
      the jovenes (young people from the church) and ate tacos al
      pastor (this is pork that is roasted and flavored with some kind
      of secret sauce).  The tacos are then topped with salsa,
      cilantro, onions, and at the good places pineapple.  They´re my
      favorite Mexican food since you can´t find authentic tacos al
      pastor in the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday: The jovenes had a special lesson on dating during the
      time that everyone else was listening to the sermon.  They heard
      a lot of great advice, but also were left feeling kinda
      hopeless, I think because their leader came off sounding like he
      was against people having fun while dating.  I was excited to
      share with them some of the ways that God has blessed me through
      my relationship with Jon.  We didn´t start dating for the fun of
      it, but God has allowed us to have a lot of fun together while
      seeking His guidance about our relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday: Jon finally bought a new suit when we spent our day of
      rest together.  Actually, he bought three for 3,200 pesos (about
      360 dollars).  I look forward to getting to go out somewhere
      nice when we get back so that he can wear one and I can wear the
      new dress I haven´t bought yet.  We also wandered around the
      shopping district in the center of the city and had a lot of
      fun.  Unfortunately, there wasn´t much rest to be had with all
      that walking.  I also finished reading <u>Through Gates of
      Splendor</u> by Elisabeth Eliott.  It´s about her husband and four
      other men who were killed by the Ecuadorian Indians who they
      were planning to share Christ with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday-Thursday: All these days have just run together in my
      mind.  We worked on our clown show a lot and will perform it
      tomorrow in addition to teaching the people at my teammates´s
      church how to be clowns.  I got a rest from teaching ESL as my
      roommate April taught.  Most of our students have been people
      from the church, but that has been a good opportunity to get to
      know them better.  A few businessmen from the neighborhood have
      also come and had questions about the church to ask after class.
      Each night after dinner we spent a while talking to our family.
      I have really enjoyed the way they spend a lot of time
      interacting and talking after meals rather than watching TV all
      the time.  On the fourth, we learned about American, Canadian,
      and Mexican independence days since all three countries are
      represented within Spearhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday: This morning, my Spanish class went to visit UNAM, the
      largest university anywhere.  It costs only 2 American cents to
      take classes there, so it is essentially free.  The campus is so
      huge it is call a city and it has its own bus system similar to
      the one found elsewhere in the city.  At noon, we had a Concert
      of Prayer for Mexico City and spent an hour asking God to heal
      many of the things that the forces of evil are doing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRAISES:
    <ul>
      <li>Each day I get closer to people here and learn much more
      from the Bible and other books I´m reading.</li>

      <li>I have had some REALLY good food this week and none of it
      has made me sick.</li>
      
      <li>God continues to prove Himself amazingly faithful and
      trustworthy.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      PRAYER REQUESTS:
    <ul>
      <li>Increased rest.  I´m getting six to eight hours of sleep per
      night, but not feeling rested enough.</li>

      <li>A successful clown show tomorrow.  Many of my teammates have
      very little Spanish ability, and after we perform our show we
      will all be telling the children about the Bible using
      multi-colored bracelets that we make.</li>

      <li>Fun next Monday.  April and I told Isaí (our little brother)
      that we would take him to the zoo, but we found out that all the
      government´s places to visit are closed on Mondays.  We hope we
      will be able to spend some quality time with him anyway since
      today is his last day of school.</li>

      <li>That God would show me what He wants me to do when I get
      back, but that I wouldn´t begin thinking about it so much that I
      live in the future and get worried again.</li>

      <li>That more people, especially people who aren´t part of our
      church would start attending the English classes.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
