    <h1 class="title">My experience with an HMO</h1>

    <p>
      When I first started working for Raytheon full-time, I had to
      pick a medical insurance plan.  Since I never go to the doctor,
      I just picked the cheapest available plan, which was an HMO.
      When I married Joy, we decided to go for the slightly more
      expensive HMO, Kaiser, because her family had been covered by
      Kaiser as long as she could remember.  We didn't spend very much
      time thinking about the options.  We figured that if there was
      something we didn't like, we'd just change plans at the end of
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      HMOs have a bad image in this country, because there is a
      feeling that they are huge companies, motivated almost purely by
      profit, and therefore resist as much as possible expensive tests
      and treatments, even at the risk of patient health.  Perhaps the
      most gruesome, if not eloquent manifestation of that feeling,
      was a man who shot himself on an LA freeway in 1998 with a sign
      that said, "HMO's are in it for the money!! Live free, love safe
      or die."  And of course HMOs <em>are</em> in it for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's the way health care works in the U.S.; doctors,
      hospitals and insurers make money by selling health care to
      consumers.  And no matter where you live, someone, somewhere has
      to look at the monetary cost of the health care you receive and
      decide whether or not the benefit is worth it.  If you live in
      Canada, that person works somewhere in the government
      bureaucracy.  If you live in Mexico, that person is probably
      you.  The only difference with an HMO is that you (or whoever is
      paying your insurance) is paying the HMO to make those
      decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, my wife and I are getting ready to have a baby.
      Because Joy likes to do things right, and needs to know what's
      going on with her, we started taking a birthing class taught by
      a <a href="http://www.bradleybirth.com/">Bradley Method&reg;</a>
      instructor.  In ten weeks, we are learning all sorts of details
      about bringing a healthy child into the world.  Everything about
      the process is explained with stark honesty.  We've seen many
      videos of women giving birth: some in the hospital, others at
      home, some in beds with stirrups, others in bathtubs, some with
      painkillers, other with their husbands sitting behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this class has been to give Joy and I a lens
      through which to view our hospital, doctors and nurses.  I think
      that it is a more clear lens than what most people use, though I
      could very well be wrong.  From where we sit, our HMO is doing a
      lot of things right; some of which other hospitals are doing
      wrong.  Let me tell a quick story to illustrate:
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my coworkers congratulated me on our impending child and
      immediately afterward told me, "Children are expensive."  When I
      asked what he meant, he told me that with his non-HMO plan he
      had paid a copay for each of the procedures done for his wife
      and child.  Since I've been learning about labor and delivery
      procedures, I asked what happened.  First his wife noticed she
      had lost her mucus plug, so they called the hospital and were
      told that they needed to come in right away because there was a
      risk of infection.  Once they arrived at the hospital, they
      induced labor with Pitocin since she hadn't yet experienced any
      contractions.  After several hours, she still hadn't started
      labor, so the doctor performed a Cesarean, which kept her in the
      hospital a couple extra days.  The net result was that he paid a
      significant percentage of the thousands of dollars that this
      pregnancy cost over a more normal vaginal birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes this story tragic is that his wife probably could
      have had a normal birth.  Women routinely loose the mucus plug
      (which is <em>not</em> the same as having their water break)
      days or even weeks before labor.  It's like throwing out the
      ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game; it happens a shortly
      before the start of the game, but it doesn't signify much more
      than that.  They shouldn't have even checked into the hospital
      at that point.  Everything else that happened to them happened
      as a natural consequence of thinking labor had started before
      anything had happened.  It would be as if the umpire had called
      strike one on the "first pitch", and, since no one else came to
      bat, canceled the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I know what would happen if Joy and I showed up
      at our hospital before her first contraction.  They'd send us
      home.  There's a strong financial motivation to avoid
      unnecessary procedures like inducing labor because the HMO bears
      the cost.  I can't be sure, because I don't know the details,
      but I suspect that the hospital my coworker went to knew that
      inducing labor and performing a C-section were unnecessary, but
      did it anyway.  There's a strong financial motivation to do
      extra procedures, because the patient and their insurance bear
      the cost, and the hospital makes a profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes our teacher brings in former students to tell us about
      their birth experiences.  So far we've heard about a home birth
      and two women who gave birth at one of our HMO's hospitals.  The
      woman who had her child at home told us that her midwife checked
      the baby during labor with a handheld Doppler stethoscope like
      our doctor does during prenatal visits.  The women who went to
      the hospital were asked to get on an IV, be strapped to a fetal
      monitor and stay in bed once labor began in earnest.  My wife,
      like most pregnant women, hates the thought of being put on IV
      and a monitor because she wants to be able to move around and
      find a comfortable position.  Most hospitals like to have women
      on the monitors because one nurse can monitor multiple women
      from the comfort of the nurses station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both women were able to avoid being stuck in bed by refusing to
      get attached to the IV and asking to be monitored only 15
      minutes out of the hour.  This is the weakness of any
      bureaucracy&mdash;eventually policies have to be enforced by a
      real human.  The nurses gave in to the women's demands because
      ultimately it was easier to bend the rules than to deal with an
      angry pregnant woman.  It's instructive that both women reported
      having trouble with the doctor that took over when their nurse
      went on break.  Doctors are higher up on the authority chain and
      find it harder to break the rules.  Imagine if every pregnant
      woman demanded personal care!
    </p>
    <p>
      Breastfeeding is, as we now know, the best way to feed babies.
      Lots of studies have shown that babies who are breastfed, even
      for a few days after birth, and their mothers are healthier than
      families that bottle-feed formula.  But companies that
      manufacture and sell baby formula spend millions of dollars a
      year trying to convince mother to use <em>their</em> product.
      Private hospitals would deny it, but they don't have any reason
      to push mothers to nurse and at least indirect reasons to
      encourage formula.  Not so with HMOs.  We heard over and over
      that breast milk is best for babies.  The HMO knows that in the
      long run they'll lose money if their patients don't nurse
      because healthy babies are much cheaper to provide care for than
      sick babies.  Our hospital gives a little kit to new mothers
      that is provided by a formula company.  A nurse told us that
      they are not allowed to remove anything from the bag, but that
      mothers who plan to nurse can throw away the formula sample
      since they won't need it.
    </p>
    <h2>What actually happened</h2>
    <p>
      It turns out that my son, Joshua, was born in Denver, Colorado
      about two weeks before his due date.  Joy's water broke about
      midnight and she had a few contractions during the night, but we
      took our time getting to the hospital.  Our HMO operates in
      Colorado, but they do things a little different than they do in
      California.  They operate a small group of clinics and contract
      out to local hospitals for things like labor and delivery.  I
      don't know exactly how this works, but the upshot is that Joshua
      was born in a private hospital associated with the Catholic
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we expected, once we got to the hospital, the doctors wanted
      to induce labor immediately because of the risk of infection.
      Joy kept telling them that she wanted to wait for the
      contractions to start on their own.
