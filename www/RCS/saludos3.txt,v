Subject: Saludos de M峰ico (3)

I only have a few minutes left after reading the many emails I
received from friends and family--what a wonderful encouragement
to have so many emails with so much information about what압
going on with you.

Here압 a rundown of my past week:
Sunday: I had to take a quick cat nap in church as the cold that
has finally left me and the lack of sleep the night before
wouldn앖 let me keep my eyes open.  Fortunately, after a couple
minutes of rest I was wide awake for the rest of the time.  That
afternoon, I ate the best turkey ever (roasted somehow) for
lunch and took a good long nap aabuelita압 (Mexican
grandmother압 house).

Monday: Since it was my day of rest, I got to finally spend an
afternoon with Jon out in the city.  We didn앖 go far, but
tomorrow we plan to go to the Palacio de Bellas Artes (the fine
arts hall) this next Monday.  I앐 not sure yet if it압 OK to let
Mexicans know that I앐 going out with Jon alone, even though we
are dating.  Males and females don앖 tend to hang out in public
unless theyre married, dating (not as common for Christians),
or in a huge group of friends.  Last week, I told them where I
was going, but let them assume that I was going alone.  I hope
to be able to talk to them about this soon so that I don앖 feel
like I앐 being deceptive. 

Tuesday through Thursday: Days were filled with Spearhead
meetings and time spent learning our clown show.  Afternoons and
evenings I prepared for and taught ESL.  Class size has hovered
at around six, but at least that way students get individual
attention.  This was the first time I had ever taught three days
in a row, and it압 good to have that milestone under my belt. 
Next week, I get to be the assistant as my roommate April
teaches the class.  I앐 looking forward to observing someone
else teach again.  After classes, we ate dinner with our family
and stayed up late talking.  I love that part of Mexican culture
and I hope that when I앐 in charge of family meals someday I
will be able to get everyone to stick around at least for a
little while talking.

Friday: The whole Spearhead group boarded two busses and visited
the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the pyramids of
Teotihuacan.  Since I had already seen both those sites, it was
good to walk around with Jon and see them afresh through his
eyes.  Once again, I was deeply saddened to see the way
Guadalupe is essentially idolized and Christ is forgotten, or
only remembered as bleeding and powerless.  For the second year
in a row, I climbed both the Sun and the Moon.  My team built a
human pyramid on top of the Sun pyramid.  It was nice to have to
freedom to show Jon around and look at all the smaller points of
interest with him, translating some signs and sharing the
information that I had learned at both places on previous
visits.

Saturday:  So far, I have rested a lot and had lots of time to
spend reading my Bible and praying.  It has been nice to spend
this time in the morning while I앐 awake rather than at night
when it압 all I can do to keep my eyes open and concentrate.  As
I have read through the New Testament multiple chapters at a
time, I have been able to learn things that never really stood
out before.  This afternoon, we have a team activity with the
jovenes (young people) from my church, and I앐 looking forward
to it.

Now it압 time for praises and prayer requests.
Praises:
--My cold is gone and my health is very good.
--I have had a fun, safe time all week.
--God is providing for me in every sense possible, even the
areas I was most concerned about before coming.
--I have gotten really close to my Mexican family in only two
weeks.
--ESL classes are going well and April and I have worked out
many of the logistics already.

Prayer requests:
--Continued wisdom about some decisions that need to be made and
some important conversations that need to be had.
--Continued healthy attitude and sensitivity to the things God
is teaching me now and showing me about lessons he began
teaching this past school year.
--Effective use of time and other resources in doing the things
that God has brought me here to do.
--Continued growth in number and quality of relationships with
Mexicans and Spearheaders.
