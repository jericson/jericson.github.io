I have had a very long week already, and it압 not over yet! 
Here압 what it looked like...

Saturday:
My team had its very first clown show and it went amazingly
well.  Our leaders said it was the best first clown show they
had ever seen.  We went up and down abandoned railroad tracks
inviting the children of squatter families (who live in
thrown-together houses on someone else압 land) to go to the park
and watch the show.  Many came, and there were also tons of
other people already hanging out because that압 what people do
on Saturday afternoons.  We could barely yell over the traffic
and other random noise, but people heard about Jesus and we gave
out about a hundred bracelets after the show that use colors to
explain the Gospel.  And I started losing my voice.

Sunday:  Our baby brother was presented to the congregation at
church and after the service there was a huge party for both the
boys since the older one just turned 7.  I felt a little more
sick.

Monday:  I surprised Jon with a picnic lunch before we went
shopping at an artisan market called the Ciudadela.  It was a
fun, relaxing day, but I was really tired.  I discovered later
that this is because I was getting sick again.

Tuesday:  We had more than double the previous number of
students in our ESL class, shocking both April and I.  I had
incorporated Third Day압 "Love Song" into the plan for that day,
so I got to tell all sorts of random people who might have never
been to church before that Jesus loves them and died on the
cross just to save them and be with them forever in Heaven.  

Wednesday:  I was really sick by this point.  I ditched Spanish
class and Spearhead meetings to rest.  I barely made it through
ESL, but we learned a lot about adjectives with opposite
meanings.  We were back down to our few faithful students.

Thursday:  I finally started taking Robitussin and getting
better.  Other than that, just the usual for a Thursday.

Friday:  I rested this morning and then went to the Diego Rivera
museum with some people from Spearhead.  We had all picked this
museum over the other possibilities because we wanted to see his
paintings.  We didn앖 see any.  There were a few sketches, but
the majority of the place was his collection of pre-hispanic
art.  The building was really neat since he designed it and the
mosaics on the ceiling.

Praises from this week:
--God is continuing to show Himself to be a provider of every
last little thing I need.
--My roommate April and I are continuing to get really close to
each other and our family.
--The medicine is working and I앐 getting better.
--I got some really good rest.

Prayer request:
--Continued improvement and maintenance of my health.  I앐 not
sure why this cold came back after I was well for a week.
--Making the best use of the time I have left.  Half the summer
is over already!
--Insight and wisdom about what to do when I get back.  The only
thing I know for sure is that I have to keep taking classes to
finish my degree, I앏l be in the same fellowship, and still
dating Jon.  Everything else is up in the air.
--Successful team events (such as workshops, church services,
clown shows, and sharing the Gospel).

My head압 getting stuffy again and I앐 out of time so I앏l sign
off for now and look forward from hearing from you soon!
