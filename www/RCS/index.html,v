    <h2>My Family</h2>
    
    <p>
      Joshua Lewis Ericson was born on May 28, 2003 in Denver,
      Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first visit with our Doctor was on January 8, 2002.  She
      gave us the results of Joy's blood tests, and everything is
      fine.  We also listened to the baby's heartbeat with a Doppler
      stethoscope.  It's wonderful to hear the quick, steady beat of
      the heart simulating blood-flow.  I guess I never understood the
      "Miracle of Birth" before now.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 14, 2003 we went into the big Kaiser hospital on
      Sunset Boulevard (where Joshua would have been born) to have a
      more extensive ultrasound.  It was amazing!  We could see the
      skeleton, the four chambers of the heart, facial features and
      even the baby sucking its thumb!  The technician also determined
      that we would have a boy.  More importantly, the baby appears to
      be healthy and developing well.  Most problems are found either
      in this ultrasound or in the blood tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started a ten week birth class taught by a <a
      href="http://www.bradleybirth.com/">Bradley Method®</a>
      teacher.  It's very interesting and I'll have to tell you about
      it sometime.

      collection </a> for more pictures (including my brother, Bob).
    </p>

    <h2>Engagement</h2>

    <p>
      I asked Joy to marry me at <a
      href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National
      Park</a>.  Here is a <a href="image/ring-topo.jpg">topographical
      map</a> of the place I asked her.  And this is an <a
      href="image/ring-aerial.jpg">aerial picture</a>.  Oddly I didn't
      think of the <a href="image/ring.jpg">"Jumbo Rock"</a>
      joke&mdash;she did.  More information about our wedding can be
      found at <a
      href="http://www.theknot.com/members/JoyMcMasters&amp;JonEricson">
      http://www.theknot.com/members/JoyMcMasters&amp;JonEricson</a>.
      My mom discovered that Joy and I were married on the
      66<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of <a
      href="http://www.joshua.tree.national-park.com/info.htm#esta">Joshua
      Tree</a>.

    <p>
      Joy and I went to México for two months in Summer 2001 with <a
      href="http://www.spearhead.org">Spearhead</a>.  One of my
      responsibilities was to write the <a
      href="pre-spearhead2001.pdf">support letter</a>.

      Here is an <a href="image/mexico-aerial.jpg">aerial image of
      Mexico City</a>.  The Spearhead office, Spanish classes,
      meetings and Joy's family were on <a
      href="image/mexico-map.jpg">Liverpool</a>.  More importantly (in
      a city with a ration of public to private transportation inverse
      compared to Los Angeles), it was close to Metro <a
      href="image/TLinea1.jpg">Linea 1</a>, between
      <em>Cuauhtémoc</em> and <em>Insurgentes</em>.  I lived in the
      south-east corner of Mexico City.  It took about 20 minutes via
      Micro (small buses) to get to <em>Constitución de 1917</em> on
      <a href="image/TLinea8.jpg">Linea 8</a>.  From there, it took
      another 45 minutes to an hour to get to class in the morning.
      Joy's "commute" was 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Ribbeck and I lived with José Carbente Hernandez and his
      mother Isabel.  "Next door" (each house shares a wall with the
      houses on either side) lived Isabel's mother (abuelita), brother
      and his family.  One of Isabel's nieces, Marcela Reyes, lived
      nearby and came to visit fairly often.  Every morning Isabel
      made breakfast for us, then left to cook and clean for another
      family in order to earn a living.  José worked all over the city
      with a construction crew.  When we came home from Spearhead
      events there was always some sort of juice to drink&mdash;pineapple,
      orange, <em>tamarindo</em>, <em><a
      href="http://www.desertusa.com/magoct97/oct_pa/du_prkpear.html">
      tuna</a></em>(a fruit, not a fish), lime, watermelon, papaya,
      guava, and (most importantly) <a href="pepino.html">cucumber</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mexico">Debriefing</h3>
    <p>
      Joy and I wrote a <a href="post-spearhead2001.pdf">letter of
      thanks</a>.

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>
      My brother Dave got married in May, 2002.  Their
      web-page is <a
      href="http://www.theknot.com/members/SarahSloat&amp;DavidEricson">
      http://www.theknot.com/members/SarahSloat&amp;DavidEricson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My other brother, Doug, just got engaged.  So in the proud
      tradition of the Ericsons, he set up a <a
      href="http://dericson.sbpnet.com/">webpage</a>.  But don't click
      over there; it will shock you with its mediocrity.  (You asked
      for it Doug.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I know, my other brother, Bob, doesn't have a website
      and isn't engaged.  
    </p>

    <h2>Bible Study</h2>
    <p>
      I reformatted <a href="galatians.pdf">Galatians</a> for the <a
      href="http://www.alphagammaomega.com">Alpha Gamma Omega
      fraternity</a> (A&Gamma;&Omega;) Bible study that I led.
    </p>

    <h2>Church</h2>
    <p>
      I attend <a
      href="http://calvarybiblechurch.org/spanishhttp://www.calvarybiblechurch.org/spanish_ministries.aspx">Iglesia
      Biblica El Calvario</a> in Burbank.  Our pastor, Dan Balderas,
      performed our marriage and led us in pre-marital counseling.  He
      died in the Fall of 2003 after a long struggle with cancer.

    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>
      I've loved books as long as I can remember.  Lately I've been
      using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to
      typeset public domain books like <a href="ltprn10.pdf"><em>The
      Light Princess</em></a> by George MacDonald.  If you intend to
      print a copy, you might want a <a href="ltprn10s.pdf">version in
      signature format</a>.  For those interested, I also have the <a
      href="ltprn10.tex">source file</a>.  Thanks to <a
      href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> for
      providing the text of this and many other books in ASCII format.
      You can also buy a copy from <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374444587/jonericson-20">
      Amazon</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Profession</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I am a computer programmer with <a
      href="http://jpl.stx.com/">Raytheon</a>, a contractor for the <a
      href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.
      My project is the <a
      href="http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/">Tropospheric Emission
      Spectrometer</a>, which is scheduled to launch in 2004.
      Previously, I was part of the ground support team for the <a
      href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">Shuttle Radar Topography
      Mission</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my work is in <a
      href="http://www.ioccc.org/index.html">C</a>, <a
      href="http://www.kornshell.com/">Korn shell</a> and <a
      href="http://www.oracle.com">PL/SQL</a> at the moment, but I
      much prefer <a href="http://perl.com/">Perl</a>.  <a
      href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/">Perl 6</a> is still in
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you understood the previous paragraph, you've probably
      guessed that I'm a fan of the <a
      href="http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/">Unix</a> operating
      system.  I think of it as a "literate" computer system, since
      everything can be done by typing words.  Unlike writing (which
      moved from hieroglyphs to letters), computer system design seems
      to move from words to images.  I still use Windows so that I can
      use programs like Quicken and to play games which aren't
      available on Unix machines.  <a
      href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> (a Unix-like layer over
      Microsoft Windows) is the best of both worlds.  You might find
      this <a
      href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">essay</a> by
      Neal Stephenson interesting, though I don't completely agree
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of full disclosure, I must say that I am an <a
      href="http://xemacs.org">XEmacs</a> user.  It stands at one of
      the twin peaks of Unix editor evolution.  (On the other peak
      stands <a href="http://vim.org">Vim</a>.)  With a little work
      you can make it do nearly anything, including <a
      href="mail-sort.html">sort mail</a>.  It's also darn good at
      editing documents.
    </p>

    <h2>Not <em>that</em> Jon Ericson</h2>
    <p>
      You might as well know that I am <em>not</em> <a
      href="http://www.drake.edu/artsci/rhetcom/facstaff.html">a
      Professor Emeritus of Rhetoric and Communication Studies at
      Drake University</a>.  Nor am I <a
      href="http://sf.www.lysator.liu.se/~chief/wstainor.html">a
      bassist for a Scandinavian Indie band called
      <em>Stardog</em></a>.

      Joy and I are having a baby!  We don't know anything about it
      right now except that the due-date is June 15.  If you feel the
      need to buy gifts, we put some ideas on our <a
        href="http://www.findgift.com/cgi-local/Registry.cgi?m=View&rid=00360369963389724384039">registry</a>. 
      (Sadly, the <a
      href="http://www.organizedregistry.com/unipad.php?acctid=1811">
      old registry</a> has disappeared.)  On December 11, 2002 we got
      our first <a href="image/baby-12-11-02.jpg">look</a> at our
      child.  I don't think either one of us believed that the
      pregnancy was for real until we saw it.

      Sunset Boulevard (where the baby will be born) to have a more
      extensive ultrasound.  It was amazing!  We could see the

      the gender, but you'll have to talk to us to find out for
      yourself.  More importantly, the baby appears to be healthy and
      developing well.  Most problems are found either in this
      ultrasound or in the blood tests.
