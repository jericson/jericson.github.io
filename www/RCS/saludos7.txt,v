Subject: Saludos de Mexico (7)

I can´t believe this is my last Tuesday with my Mexican family. 
In a few hours less than a week I´ll be back at the hotel (only
a block away from my house) for Closing Conference.  This has
been a crazy week, so I´ll jump right in.

Last Sunday:  I have almost no recollection what happened.  I
think we went to the anthropology museum after church with some
young people from church, ate at Burger King, and then went to
bed early.

Last Monday:  I woke up kinda sick again.  We had a clown show
really far away.  I almost fainted on the Metro twice (probably
because of low blood sugar) but was better after drinking a
large Sprite.  After an hour bus ride, I realized I was having
"serious stomach issues" when I had to use the bathroom a lot at
my teammates´ house.  I was worried about taking the Micro
(small bus) to the church because I felt like I was going to
throw up.  Fortunately, the Pepto settled my stomach down before
too long, but I had to let my team leader Theresa fill in for me
in the clown show.  She was more than happy to help out!  I think
I had some sort of mild food poisoning or grease shock from
eating at Burger King after not having American fast food for
six weeks.

Tuesday through Thursday:  My "cold" came back with a vengeance
and I decided that if the Spearhead nurse didn´t tell be to buy
some antibiotics I was going to go get some on my own.  You
don´t need a prescription in Mexico for anything, so even when
she did finally tell me to get Amoxicillin, I just went to the
pharmacy and asked for it.  I ended up not teaching ESL all week
because God caused the students to either not show up or tell me
I was too sick to teach.  I finally got a lot of rest last week!
 By Wednesday, I had become completely exhausted in every sense
of the word and slipped into a depression for a couple days, but
as I got rest and spent more time reading my Bible I came out of
it very quickly.  I praise God that He has showed me (and Jon
too) what I need to do to deal with those times in a healthy
way.  That is just one area in which it has been exciting to see
growth this summer.

Friday:  After 24 hours on antibiotics, I was feeling a lot
better and had enough energy both for Theresa´s birthday party
and the clown show in a really poor neighborhood that followed. 
It was great to get to shower her with gifts including pink
suede shoes that she has worn ever since.  The neighborhood
where we did the show has a Friday afternoon Bible club that a
family there and some Brazilian missionaries put on.  It was
awesome to bless the people who participate in that with the
treat of a clown show.  We also gave the Christian woman who
lives there an opportunity to invite more people from the
neighborhood to the classes.  That night, we went to a velada
(all-night prayer meeting that turned into a slumber party in the
middle when we stopped for more cake and some dancing).  I
slept most of the night because I was still pretty sick and
knew that without sleep I wouldn´t get well.

Saturday:  Once we finally got going in the morning, we went to
Kristan and Allison´s church to practice and prepare for the
church service we were supposed to lead the next day.  We had
everything worked out perfectly, so of course everything changed
the next day.  That afternoon I finally got to go to the jovenes
(youth) group meeting at church.  The group is just getting
started, so they focus on the ultra-basics, but I think it´s a
good opportunity for them to get to know each other at church
without all the adults around.

Sunday:  When we got to the church for the culto (service) we
found out that the Presbyterians already had their whole
elaborate order of service worked out and they only wanted us to
be part of the worship time (after all the hymns had finished)
and the preaching.  We managed to work in everything we wanted
to do including an awesome testimony about how much God has
changed one of my teammate´s lives.  The service went really
late, but oh well, this is Mexico.  I think we scared this "dead
as a doornail" church with our upbeat songs, bass guitar, and
clapping, but sometimes people need that.  It was the coldest
church I had ever seen.  The pastor didn´t have to tell people
to stop greeting each other and sit down so the service could
start because they had already been sitting silently with blank
expressions on their faces for a while.  There are also racial
problems in the church since there is a huge group of indigenous
people from Chiapas there.  The sermon was on unity and the guy
who preached talked about the amazing work God did when all the
Christian groups on his college campus united as the body of
Christ rather than individual groups.

Monday:  I had a good, long time to rest in the morning.  I read
my Bible, wrote in my journal, and read a little.  Jon had hoped
to take me to Xochimilco but his clown show ended really late. 
We ended up going to Coyoacan (the area where painter Frida
Kahlo lived) to eat and talk.

Prayer requests:
--Spiritual health and unity at the church where we went on
Sunday, Adalides del Señor.
--That we would be able to leave on a good note.  Since I´ve
been sick, I haven´t been able to help around the house as much
as I should.
--A fun end-of-ESL party on Wednesday night, as well as
opportunities for good conversations with our students.
--Renewed faith and strength for Theresa.  She has a genetic
illness that causes her to have diarrhea every day and recently
the devil and people who are supposedly Christians have been
telling her that she hasn´t been healed because she isn´t really
a Christian and her faith isn´t sufficient.  Someone did this
again on Sunday, and I pointed her to John 9 where Jesus heals
the man born blind.
--That I wouldn´t get sick again.
--Preparing for re-entry shock and not having the support group
that is my team and roommate.

Praises:
--I´ve been getting enough rest and I think I´m finally well.
--God has taught me tons of lessons, so many that I´m not
consciously sure what they all are.
--We made it through our four clown shows last week and all were
successful in their own ways.
--I haven´t been worrying about the future even though there´s
plenty to potentially be worried about.
--We saw our sick little brother walk a lot last night, and he
can now eat tortillas.  God answered a LOT of prayers.
--Jon is in love with Mexico now too and God has begun showing
us more ways that we can minister together when we get back home
and possibly in Latin America in the future.

Thanks again for all of your prayers.
¡Que Dios les bendiga!
