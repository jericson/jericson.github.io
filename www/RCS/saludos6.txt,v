Subject: Saludos de México (6)

First, I want you to know that my cold has finally left me for
the second time.  Now, for the events of the past week:

Last Saturday:  I went to Xochimilco (Mexico´s version of
Venice, Italy) with my team in the morning and had a great time
relaxing while we were conducted through the canals.  We shopped
in a market by the embarcadero (dock) in the afternoon and I
bought a beautiful lace tablecloth with a cala lily pattern for
only 80 pesos (a little over $8).  In the evening we gave an
evangelism workshop and went out to talk to people in the
neighborhood.  I talked with some of the saddest teens I have
ever met.  They were so apathetic that I don´t think they would
have cared if they died that evening, and they cared even less
about where they might go when they die.  One, Saul, is a Satan
worshiper I think and as the three of us talked to him I began
to wonder if he was possessed or something.  His eyes were so
vacantly dark.

Sunday:  The famous Pastor Tilopillo (the voice of John
MacArthur on Spanish radio) preached at our church because he
was in town for a conference he was leading.  He was a good
enough preacher, but I don´t think I was as impressed as all the
hermanos at church.  In the afternoon, we went to Coyocan with
some of the young people from church and had fun despite all the
New Age hippies.

Monday:  I traveled out to Jon´s church to watch his team´s
clown show, meet his family (how many girls get to meet their
boyfriend´s family for the first time twice), and climb "The
Mountain" with them.  The path up was kinda hard but had enough
rocks to get a sure footing.  The main challenge was getting
enough air since my chest was still full of phlegm.  Let´s just
say that on the way down the ground kept moving out from under
me and I went down the longest sand slide in the world.  I was
black with dirt when we reached the bottom, and Jon was giggling
 because he was having so much fun at the expense of my personal
hygiene.

Tuesday:  I got to talk with a few of our students about Jesus
and the Bible before English Class, and that was a great
encouragement since so many of our other students are from the
church.  I also got to eat a chocolate-covered popsicle for the
first time in weeks, and that was a great treat.  I borrowed
_Shadow of the Almighty_ from the Spearhead library and have
enjoyed reading about Jim Elliot´s life in his own words.

Wednesday:  I took my final exam for Spanish class.  Not much
else exciting happened that I can remember.

Thursday:  We had a party to celebrate the end of Spanish
classes.  That night after it stopped raining, I washed my
clothes outside at night for the first time.  They finally dried
today after getting wet again yesterday.  I can´t wait to use my
parents´ washing machine again.

Friday:  We went to the water park at Oaxtepec an hour south of
the city.  I got to relax without getting a sun burn (I think
Jon avoided one too).  The drive though the mountains was
gorgeous as always.

Saturday (today):  We had a clown show again this morning and it
went great.  Even though we hadn´t practiced in two weeks, I
think our performance was better.  The location was much better,
and the children were very receptive.  

Praises:  
--I´m well.
--God has given me some vision for what He wants me to do with
myself outside of class this next school year.
--After talking to our papá about how important it is to
celebrate things if they are special to one´s spouse, he renewed
his habit of brining her random useful gifts after work.
--Jon gets to be a computer geek and help out the Spearhead
office situation this next week.

Prayer requests:
--That we would be able to make it through the three clown shows
we have this week without getting too tired or losing our
voices.
--Guidance for Jon and me as we continue to mold our
relationship to God´s desires.
--Continued vision and guidance in the area of ministry (both
here and at home).
--Good use of free time these next weeks as the end of Spanish
classes will leave me with a lot more time on my hands.
--Just the right attendance and just the right lessons to teach
in English this week since I´m the one responsible for teaching.

Thank you again for all of your support, especially through
encouragement and prayer.  I took three rolls of film to be
developed today and I look forward to using the photos to share
about my trip with you.
