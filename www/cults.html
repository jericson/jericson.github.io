    <p>
      Scientology has an answer to the question: <a
      href="http://faq.scientology.org/page29.htm">"Why do some people
      oppose Scientology?"</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "There are certain characteristics and mental attitudes that
      cause a percentage of the population to oppose violently any
      betterment activity or group. This small percentage of the
      society (roughly 2 percent) cannot tolerate that Scientology is
      successful at improving conditions around the world. This same 2
      percent is opposed to any effective self-betterment
      activity. The reason they so rabidly oppose Scientology is
      because it is doing more to help society than any other
      group. Those who are upset by seeing man get better are small in
      number compared to the millions who have embraced Scientology
      and its efforts to create a sane civilization and more freedom
      for the individual."
    </blockquote>

      It seems that I am part of this "2 percent" that opposes
      Scientology.  But is it fair to say that I "rabidly oppose
      Scientology is because it is doing more to help society than any
      other group"?  
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if C.S.Lewis had Scientology in mind when he was
      writing <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684823853/jonericson-20">
      <em>That Hideous Strength?</em></a> I suppose not, since that
      book was written in 1943 and Scientology was established in
      1950.  Still the parallels are obvious.
