      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

Sadly,  R.O.B. will not be making a triumphant return, but fortunately Nintendo has found an equally tantalizing surprise: a controller with a touchscreen.  What I love about the idea is that it effectively allows players to move even further from the TV and even free it up for other uses.  To understand why this could be very valuable, you need to understand how the living room works as a public space. &lt;p&gt;I know a lot of gamers have dedicated gaming displays in the form of either TVs in another room or computer monitors.  For these people, the &lt;a href="http://e3.nintendo.com/hw/#/about"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; is solving a problem they don't have.  But in many households, the living room TV is a multipurpose device.  If my wife and son what to watch a show (via Netflix on the Wii), I can't play a game on the Wii.  If my son and I are playing a Wii game, my wife can't watch TV shows.  If my son is in the room, I can't play any game that I don't think is appropriate for him.   &lt;p&gt;But if the new controller lives up to its promise, each of these issues could be solved.  When you throw in the new gameplay styles the controller would facilitate and the more powerful pixel-pushing hardware, the new system seems like a winner.

Today I'd like to look at the health of the Wii platform in reference to those three areas.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardware manufacture&lt;/h3&gt;
Most Nintendo observers focus on it's hardware business.  While Nintendo hardware has blown away the competition in recent years, so far this year the Wii platform seems to be falling behind.
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Considering that the DS, in its various forms, has been the best selling game machine since 2006, Nintendo did well to shift to the 3DS, which seems to be off to a fast start.  Meanwhile, the Wii maintains a large lead in total consoles sold among current systems, but is clearly losing momentum at an alarming rate.  Since this is the number most people focus on, Nintendo seems to be in trouble.  By 2010 the handwriting was on the wall for both of Nintendo's platforms:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

DS      21,445,632 (-25%)  143,963,783

Total   81,731,118 (-9%)  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's important to know that historically Sony and Microsoft lose money on each console sold and Nintendo makes a &lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/34357-game-console-wars-ii-nintendo-shaves-off-profits-leaving-competition-scruffy"&gt;moderate profit&lt;/a&gt;.  This late in the console cycle, it's likely that all three consoles are making money, but Nintendo has always profited from Wii sales.  In addition, the Wii's already large install base makes selling new consoles harder.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
Nintendo's second role in the industry is as game publisher.  In this case, Nintendo's DS and Wii game sales far exceed all competitors with the possible exception of EA.
&lt;pre&gt;
Worldwide Publisher Totals 2011 (YTD)

4       Ubisoft                      6,694,007
5       Sony Computer Entertainment  4,922,930
6       Microsoft                    3,724,148
7       THQ                          3,303,488
8       Sega                         2,674,190

10      Namco Bandai                 2,540,164
&lt;/pre&gt;
While Nintendo has a big lead over EA in terms of unit sales, that seems to include games packed with hardware and does not include downloadable content.  So while it's conceivable that EA and Activision have been more successful, by no means is Nintendo failing as a publisher.
&lt;p&gt;
Most publishers rely on a hit game system which results in huge sales in the months following a game's launch after which they move to the next title.  Nintendo, which has been the leading publisher for years, has been able to create and market "evergreen" titles that sell well for several years.  Along with Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo has the advantage that each software release increases the value of their hardware business.  Nintendo re-releases titles from their back catalog more successfully than any other competitor.  Each of these strategies minimize development costs and increase profits both for DS and Wii games.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Platform licencing&lt;/h3&gt;
Finally, Nintendo takes a cut of every title sold for one of its platforms.  When it comes to evaluating launching a new platform, total software sales has to be a primary consideration.  A new console is a huge expense and risk for the manufacturer, consumer and game publishers.  The only people who benefit with certainty from a console launch are the journalists who cover the story.  As long as games are still selling on a hardware system, there's just no reason to replace it.
&lt;pre&gt;

Total 82,091,645
&lt;/pre&gt;
By game sales, the Wii is still the most successful console due in part to its massive install base.  Notice that a console, such as the PS2, can enjoy a very long software life after production ends.  A critical statistic for a console is the tie ratio, which compares the total games per console sold.  The average Xbox owner has a library of 9 or so games while average Wii and PS libraries hold just over 7 titles.  Since people continue to buy software after they buy the console, the number will tend to increase over the life of a system, which is why the oldest system has the highest number.  Handheld tie ratios will naturally be lower if only because some households will buy multiple systems and share a software library.  Tie ratios matter to the consumer because the more games they own and enjoy, the better value they wring from the console.  They matter just as much to a hardware manufacturer because they represent incremental profit on top of the original hardware sale.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
This chart shows the 2010 sales by platform and reveals that Wii software actually increased year-over-year, though not nearly as much as its rivals.  The DS, meanwhile, entered the decline portion of its life-cycle, which pushed the introduction of the 3DS.  Since the company will not be able to support two simultaneous console launches, a Wii sequel wasn't in the cards for 2011.  But if Wii sales slow this year, Nintendo may need to announce its next console soon.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the end of the day, I think there will be a successor to the Wii console, and yes it will have HD capabilities, but it probably won't come for at least a couple more years, and it will add far more than a simple bump in processing power and resolution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I couldn't agree more.  While it's far too early to make any solid guesses about what Nintendo will imagine for a  Wii successor (the very ambitious 3DS will command their limited attention for the next year or so), we can speculate about it's incremental and sustaining improvements.
&lt;p&gt;
Judging from the 3DS rollout, the next Nintendo console will:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop hardware GameCube compatibility
&lt;li&gt;Retain Wii compatibility
&lt;li&gt;Retain Virtual Console and WiiWare compatibility
&lt;li&gt;Support HD output
&lt;li&gt;Incrementally improve online functionality
&lt;li&gt;Incrementally improve anit-piracy measures
&lt;li&gt;Do something completely unexpected
&lt;/ol&gt;
Given those postulates, we can infer the new system will:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the Wiimote and have a sensor bar
&lt;li&gt;Include a disk drive
&lt;li&gt;Support transfer of Virtual Console and WiiWare titles from the Wii
&lt;li&gt;Include HDMI and adequate processing power for HD graphics
&lt;li&gt;Continue to include built-in WiFi support
&lt;li&gt;Be a shock when first announced
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What strikes me about the above conclusions is that the physical proximity between the system and the TV will be more important than the proximity between the system and the player.  In fact, if there were no need for a disk drive and a sensor bar, the console could be completely hidden from the user.  I could easily imagine digital distribution could allow Nintendo to eliminate the disk drive as Sony attempted with the PSP Go, though properly managing game transfers would be a challenge.  With care, such a system could dramatically reduce piracy while also eliminating the annoyance of changing physical media.
&lt;p&gt;
Another clue about how the company operates comes from an &lt;a href="http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mario25th/vol1_page4.jsp"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Miyamoto:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Miyamoto: 
If you think for yourself about what's wrong with your idea, and you understand the reasons why it's no good and get a handle on the problem, then you're sure to be able to use that idea sometime.
&lt;p&gt;
Itoi: 
That's right. It's a waste if you just say, "Oh, that idea's no good," and forget about it.
&lt;p&gt;
Miyamoto: 
That doesn't lead to anything. That's why, while I used to tell people to store up ideas in a drawer, I recently suggest putting ideas that were no good into a draw[sic] with the reason why they were no good affixed to them. Like writing the reason on a label.
&lt;p&gt;
...
&lt;p&gt;
Itoi: 
So you can toss an idea in storage, but it stays alive.
&lt;p&gt;
Miyamoto: 
Yes, while I stay hung up on the reason it won't work. Then one day I realize I can take off the label. When there's momentum to take off that label, I suddenly get so excited that I can take off other labels too. Things that used to appear little negative were offset and showed no real bad effect.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Among the ideas that Nintendo has resurrected are the Power Glove (the Wiimote captures the basic premise of the controller), the Power Pad (neatly replaced by the Wii Balance Board), and the Virtual Boy (the 3DS promises to correct most problems with stereoscopic 3D).  But there are dozens of ideas that have either failed in the marketplace or could be updated for the modern gaming environment.  For your consideration, I propose the next console will include an update to &lt;a href="http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index22.shtml"&gt;R.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;.  I know it's crazy.  We don't need another piece of plastic cluttering up our living rooms.  On the other hand, it's just the sort of out-of-left-field idea that Nintendo has made to work over the last few years.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/381446573516083410/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=381446573516083410' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/381446573516083410'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/381446573516083410'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2010/10/nintendos-next-console.html' title='Nintendo&apos;s next console'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2059611660193717277</id><published>2010-09-29T12:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-10-14T15:25:41.066-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NTDOY.PK'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Nintendo</title><content type='html'>I recently bought ADR shares of Nintendo at $35 a share.  To be completely honest, I did almost no upfront valuation or analysis of the company.  I just like their products.  But looking back at the decision, it actually makes sense.
&lt;p&gt;
For starters, if you take the most recent annual dividend (&lt;a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2010/annual1003e.pdf"&gt;$1.25&lt;/a&gt; per ADR) and discount it at the current 2% you could get from a Japanese government 30-year bond, you get a fair value of $62.50.  Against the more reasonable US Treasury 30-year (3.875%) the fair value is $32.26 assuming no growth.  Given Nintendo closely ties it's dividends to earnings based on a formula and that Nintendo's earnings are likely to increase in the next 5 or so years, the dividend discount model suggests buying the stock.  (As I write this, Nintendo has announced that earnings and therefore the dividend will be reduced for the fiscal year ending March 2011, but that could not have factored into my decision.  I also think the announcement will prove irrelevant to long term value.  More on this below.)
&lt;p&gt;
Understanding the company's past might help us glimpse the company's future.  92 years before Donkey Kong (1981) was released, Nintendo made traditional Japanese cards called &lt;a href="http://www.hanafuda.com/"&gt;Hanafuda&lt;/a&gt;.  Until, 1963 the company manufactured playing cards (including western-style decks) at which time Nintendo branched out into other games, toys and novelties.  It was a seminal moment that shifted the focus from pure industrial design and manufacturing to considerations of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_design"&gt;experience design&lt;/a&gt;.  Having great looking and well-built decks enhances the experience of playing a card game, but the enjoyment of the game comes from the rules used to play it.  A puzzle, like &lt;a href="http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/nintendo.htm"&gt;Ten Billion Barrel&lt;/a&gt; (1980), must be designed with the whole experience in mind: puzzle conception, design,  manufacturing, packaging, cost, instructions, marketing and so on.  Before 1963, Nintendo was a pure hardware company and afterward became a hybrid software/hardware company.
&lt;p&gt;
All early video game companies (Atari, Magnavox, Philips, RCA, Coleco, Midway, Milton Bradley, Mattel, VTech, Commodore, etc.) were hybrid companies out of necessity&amp;mdash;true game platforms had not yet been created.  Most of these companies either dropped out of the video game industry or shifted focus to either hardware or software.  Nintendo alone survived the primordial era with a complete gaming ecosystem under it's control.  In fact, Nintendo is the only company that manages two major platforms outside of Japan with it's handheld and home console lines.  Much of their early success must be attributed to designers such as Gumpei Yokoi and his protégé Shigeru Miyamoto who began their careers designing physical toys and games.
&lt;p&gt;
Nintendo has always taken advantage of &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/mooreslaw/"&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt; by releasing electronics that are behind the leading edge of technology.  For instance, the Game Boy handheld was less capable that either the Atari Lynx or the Sega Game Gear, but was also both cheaper and more profitable.  Since the chips became less expensive over the life of the system, the retail price dropped further and Nintendo continued to make a good profit on the device.  As it became clear to game developers that the platform was the most popular handheld system on the market, they produced more games which increased the hardware's value to the consumer.  This same virtuous pattern has cropped up in the DS and the various consoles Nintendo has released.
&lt;p&gt;
Along the way, Nintendo has also excelled at producing high quality game franchises.  Mario, Metroid and Zelda games are among the &lt;a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html"&gt;highest-rated games&lt;/a&gt; of all time.  Not coincidently, Nintendo also boasts many of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises"&gt;best-selling franchises&lt;/a&gt; in video games, including Pokémon.  Since the Philips CD-i debacle, Nintendo franchises are available exclusively on Nintendo hardware creating a sort of killer app for each hardware generation.  Software, as always, sells hardware and not the other way around.
&lt;p&gt;
Nintendo's future path is fairly well laid out at this point: release new games, new hardware to facilitate those games and further exploit licencing opportunities.  Recent history shows that more and more people take up gaming as time goes on, so Nintendo must continue to find new ways to get people into their games.  Which is to say, they must continue doing what they are doing.
&lt;p&gt;
No game platform lasts forever as players need constant new experiences to stay interested and engaged.  Both the DS and Wii platforms have also sold into nearly their entire market at this point.  Therefore, Nintendo has already announced their next handheld device called the 3DS.  A replacement for the Wii is certainly in the works and ought to be released in the next few years.  In my opinion, there are a number of keys to a successful launch:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backward comparability&amp;mdash;Allowing new platforms to play games designed for current systems both gives consumers a better value (at minimal cost) when they upgrade and extends the current system's viability for developers.  Given Nintendo's massive current install base, there will likely a market for Wii and DS games for years after replacement machines go on sale.  We've seen this happen for Game Boy Advance and PS2 software.
&lt;li&gt;Improved functionality&amp;mdash;On the other hand, a new system must offer something substantially different than what is already available for consumers to risk an upgrade.  More than any other company, Nintendo stakes it's reputation on delivering novel gaming hardware.  From the D-pad to 3D technology, new hardware always adds some significant gameplay improvement over the previous platform.  (As an aside, simply upgrading the Wii's visuals to HD would do little to change gameplay.  A more radical update will be required.)
&lt;li&gt;Strong first-party launch titles&amp;mdash;A critical factor for Nintendo especially.  A single Mario or Zelda title can make the difference between buy and wait for many consumers.  The Wii broke sales records last holiday season on the back of a throwback Super Mario Bros. sequel.
&lt;li&gt;Third-party developer buy-in&amp;mdash;Conversely, Nintendo rarely needs third parties to help sell hardware.  Still, third party games at launch suggest to the consumer that there will be plenty of new experiences to be had once you've beaten Bowser for the umpteenth time.  For the 3DS, which carries the stigma of Nintendo's previous foray into stereoscopic 3D (the Virtual Boy), having so many developers building software for the system could make all the difference.
&lt;li&gt;Priced to give better value than competitors&amp;mdash;For much of Nintendo's history, it's hardware sold for less than all competitors.  A massive exception to the rule has to be the North American release of the original Nintendo Entertainment System bundle in 1985.  But given the incredible value of the NES throughout its life in terms of better games, graphics, sound and peripherals, the machine was priced to be the best selling system of its era.  Ultimately, the better Nintendo does on the first four points, the higher price they can set on hardware while remaining competitive.
&lt;li&gt;Available&amp;mdash;Sometimes you hear that Nintendo purposely held back supplies of the Wii or DS to whip up demand with artificial scarcity.  But while companies (especially hardware manufacturers) love to see inventory flying off the shelves, they don't like seeing their products resold for twice or thrice the retail price on eBay the week following a system launch.  Frothy demand on day one that leads early adopters to sleep over night on the street turns into mocking dismissal a year later.  Worse, a successful long-term platform requires those early adopters to evangelize their friends and relatives, but not having enough systems to sell cripples the process.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle.png" width=400 alt="Technology adoption life cycle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the above list, Nintendo seems to be handling the 3DS perfectly.  Delaying the launch in Japan, while missing an important buying season, will not hurt the system in the long run if it improves availability and eliminates bugs.  It's not hard to picture Mario fan-boys and tech-nerds rushing out to get their hands on the world's first stereoscopic 3D device that doesn't make you look like a dweeb, but the public at large will need to be sold on the system's value before it will shell out console cash for a handheld.  That remains true whether the system is released before or after Christmas.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2059611660193717277/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2059611660193717277' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2059611660193717277'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2059611660193717277'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-i-bought-nintendo.html' title='Why I bought Nintendo'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5048774211603751154</id><published>2009-01-14T16:28:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-01-14T16:37:09.218-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GOOG'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MSFT'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Why Facebook is a threat to Google.</title><content type='html'>When I started this blog, I picked Blogger mostly because Google had recently acquired it and I already had a Gmail account.

The S&amp;amp;P 500 barely moved up 0.66%, so my gain came from the stocks I happen to hold.  First Marblehead shot up 64.71% because, I suppose, of &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/11/25/afx5741529.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; that Leslie Alexander (the company's largest investor) bought more shares.  Random fluctuation sent Select Comfort up 28.57%.  (When a company costs a quarter a share, a few pennies change in price makes a big relative difference.)  Berkshire Hathaway is up 8.95% as investors &lt;a href="http://jeffmatthewsisnotmakingthisup.blogspot.com/2008/11/is-buffett-worried-part-ii-its-not.html"&gt;figured out&lt;/a&gt; the company is not going to fail after all.  So just a few big moves in companies I happen to own make a huge difference.
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there's a cost as well.  On the year, my IRA has lost more than half it's value due almost entirely to awful results from First Marblehead (down 91%) and Select Comfort (down 96%).  Digging out of a hole like that will be very tough even with days like today.  Both these stocks represent value traps that should have been sold long ago.  I'd sell Select Comfort today except it will cost too much in commission.  (I am shopping some December call options, but my limit price won't be filled any time soon, I think.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1564403401979188584/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1564403401979188584' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1564403401979188584'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1564403401979188584'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/11/benefit-of-concentrated-portfolio.html' title='The benefit of a concentrated portfolio'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5716492760207381268</id><published>2008-11-21T13:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-21T13:31:12.867-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>Best one-day return ever</title><content type='html'>My IRA shot up 10.93% today.

Today, I used that cash to buy First Marblehead at $1.42 a share.  That is less then 10% of what &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/02/why-i-bought-yet-more-first-marblehead.html"&gt;I paid&lt;/a&gt; for shares way back in February.  In the meantime, the credit markets have fallen apart, TERI has filed bankruptcy and First Marblehead has slashed the accounting value of its trusts.
&lt;p&gt;
Even so, I think the company is an even better buy than it was nine months ago.  The liquidation value has fallen to about $4 a share, so the market has priced in a considerable chance of complete failure.  Further, the residuals are priced as if they are extremely risky&amp;mdash;they must be discounted at 25% yield in order to get a $1.42 price.  I've been greedy all the way down, so I'm not the best person to ask.  On the other hand, there just don't seem to be any more shoes to drop.

Partially that's because I don't want to think about the carnage done to my portfolio in recent weeks and partially because I got busy with other things (i.e. buying a house).  Because I need some cash to use as a down payment, I sold off my Canon shares at a price less than what I consider to be &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/05/pricevalue-ratio.html"&gt;their value&lt;/a&gt;.  On August 6, I got $46.49 a share.  The first lot (bought in December, 2003) returned 62% compared to 6% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.  The second lot (bought in December, 2004) returned 47% compared to 7%.  The annualized return was about 11% for both lots.  Needless to say, both lots were excellent investments.
&lt;p&gt;
Canon has lost a lot of market cap since I sold, so I lucked out there.  Since Berkshire had about the same price to value ratio, I was tempted to sell it instead.  But I resisted in part because I assumed consumer electronics will be harder to sell in the next few years and Berkshire will be able to pick up some good deals over the same time period.  Like Oracle, I suspect Canon will be a compelling value and on my investment radar in the future.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2623406800269703608/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2623406800269703608' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2623406800269703608'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2623406800269703608'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-i-sold-canon.html' title='Why I sold Canon'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5477520976160949616</id><published>2008-10-10T14:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-23T15:49:10.459-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='PTTRX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>Shifting to stocks</title><content type='html'>Because the markets are free-falling and the yield curve has become more favorable, I've shifted my &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/10/wait-til-next-year.html"&gt;market-timing position&lt;/a&gt; from bonds to stocks.

In that time, the markets have been rocked and it seemed like a good time to review their performances.  The statistics (5-year return/expense ratio/turnover ratio) have been updated to include the most recent numbers I can find for them.   I'm also commenting on "last-year's season", which I define as 1-year return from October 3.  Today's market was way down, so I expect performance to be a bit worse for these funds.  My benchmark is -27%, which about what the market has lost over the same period.  Brutal.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=SGOIX"&gt;First Eagle Overseas&lt;/a&gt; - 11.59/0.88/34 (CF)&lt;/li&gt;

-18.82% &amp;mdash; For a fund that has been heavily invested in gold, losing double digits seems pretty bad.  Maybe Jean-Marie Eveillard inherited some bad positions.  Maybe, like most of us these days, he had a few positions blow up.  In any case, the fund deserved its lead-off spot as it beat the S&amp;amp;P 500 and all but one of its teammates.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=OTCFX"&gt;T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock&lt;/a&gt; - 4.61/0.71/40 (SS)&lt;/li&gt;

 -26.46% &amp;mdash; At almost exactly league average, OTCFX does not look good and hasn't for a long time.  On the other hand, I suspect the environment will turn around as more good companies get beaten down with the bad.  For the moment, I'm hanging on, but a lineup change may be coming soon.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VPMAX"&gt;Vanguard PRIMECAP&lt;/a&gt; - 7.27/0.31/11 (1B)&lt;/li&gt;

-20.04% &amp;mdash; At 7% better than average, PRIMECAP continues to be a solid performer.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=DODFX"&gt;Dodge &amp; Cox International Stock&lt;/a&gt; - 10.94/0.65/16 (RF)&lt;/li&gt;

-32.89% &amp;mdash; At 6% less than the market, my prediction that the fund might be too big for its britches seems to have been correct.  As a result, I'm demoting it to a 5% position and considering cutting it altogether.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=OAKGX"&gt;Oakmark Global&lt;/a&gt; - 8.26/1.13/35 (LF)&lt;/li&gt;

-26.94% &amp;mdash; Oakmark Global has held its own with almost exactly market returns over the last 12 months.  Since the US has done better than other countries in this market(!), that's good for a global fund.  If the fee were lower, it might well be a 10% position for me.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/StockNet/StockReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=RTN"&gt;Raytheon&lt;/a&gt; - 16.10/0.00/0 (DH)&lt;/li&gt;

-14.4% &amp;mdash; Raytheon has done well recently as it collects more government contracts.  I continue to pay only slight attention to this position, but I suspect government spending will shift away from defense in the coming years.  Hopefully, Raytheon will find a way to follow the money or build more civilian products.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/index/IndexCharts.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=SPX"&gt;S&amp;P 500 Index&lt;/a&gt; - 3.24/0.01/4 &amp; &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=PTTRX"&gt;PIMCO Total Return&lt;/a&gt; - 4.66/0.43/226 (C)&lt;/li&gt;

 -27.07% &amp;mdash;
&lt;br&gt;
  4.49% &amp;mdash; Thankfully, the PIMCO fund has been in the lineup this year so I get a modest positive return rather than the dreadful negative return.  Fortunately, I've allowed this position to grow to 25% of my account.  As of tomorrow after the close, I will have sold some of this portion to rebalance the lineup.  I'll be favoring funds that have performed well over the last 12 months and that I have confidence in.
&lt;p&gt;
The next question is: has the market fallen far enough to shift from bonds back to stocks?  As I noted when I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/01/why-im-buying-pimco-total-return-bond.html"&gt;originally bought the fund&lt;/a&gt;, the inverted yield curve was my primary reason for switching to bonds.  &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/yield-curve-strategy-nears-turning.html"&gt;Conditions have been turning&lt;/a&gt; to start favoring stocks, but it's taken most of the year.  I anticipate switching shortly after the Federal Reserve meets again to lower rates at the end of the month.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=TMCGX"&gt;Turner Emerging Growth&lt;/a&gt; - 8.54/1.55/88 (2B)&lt;/li&gt;

  -25.81% &amp;mdash; I haven't expected much from this fund and I haven't been disappointed.  The return has been only a little better than average, but that makes it one of my better positions this year.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=FEQIX"&gt;Fidelity Equity-Income&lt;/a&gt; - 2.57/0.67/24 (3B)&lt;/li&gt;
 
  -33.40% &amp;mdash; I don't plan to add money to Fidelity Equity-Income unless and until there is some compelling reason to do so.  Underperforming by 6% or so, is not compelling.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/FundNet/TotalReturns.aspx?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=UMBIX"&gt;Columbia Value &amp; Restructuring&lt;/a&gt; - 5.36/0.94/11 (P)&lt;/li&gt;
 
  -34.37% &amp;mdash; Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring has been renamed to Columbia Value &amp; Restructuring, but it has the same management and structure.  In a &lt;a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/columns/fundwatch/archive/2008/fundwatch0218.htm"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt; manager Dave Williams suggested that some restructuring situations take five or more years to develop.  I'd hoped that this fund would be counter-cyclical, but it seems to have suffered from fewer buy-outs and mergers in the last 6 months or so.

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-19.9% &amp;mdash; My fund team has not performed as well as I'd hoped during the downturn in the market, but better than the market as a whole.  PIMCO Total Return was the hero of the group as might be expected.  Among the stock funds, First Eagle Overseas and Vanguard PRIMECAP earned their high spots in the batting order.  Next year, I hope to report the S&amp;amp;P 500 anchoring a strong lineup of stock funds to make back some of this year's losses.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1472050240449978855/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1472050240449978855' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1472050240449978855'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1472050240449978855'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/10/wait-til-next-year.html' title='Wait &apos;til next year!'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4074204729744127968</id><published>2008-08-21T16:44:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-16T16:21:07.316-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='house'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='COST'/><title type='text'>Why I bought a house</title><content type='html'>On August 12, 2008, one day after our sixth wedding anniversary, Joy and I bought our &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1711-Grismer-Ave-APT-8-Burbank-CA-91504/20057616_zpid"&gt;first house&lt;/a&gt;.  Technically, it's a condominium, but architecturally, I'd call it a townhouse.  I've linked to Zillow.com, which shows our sales price of $379,045.  That works out to $276.47 a square foot.
&lt;p&gt;
I mentioned the price per square foot, but we most certainly did not buy our house as an investment.  Rather we bought our house to be a place to live.  We'd been living in a run-down 2 bedroom 900 sq/ft rental house in Pasadena since we got married.  Since then, we've:
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Added a son to the family.
  &lt;li&gt; Become active in a church in Burbank.
  &lt;li&gt; Added a second job in Glendale (Joy's job).
  &lt;li&gt; Become Costco members.  (The nearest location is in Burbank.)
&lt;/ol&gt;
Those changes prompted us to look for a three bedroom house in Burbank.  So we didn't buy with the idea of making a profit.
&lt;p&gt;
Now that doesn't mean we aren't hoping to come out ahead on the purchase.  Rather we bought what we could afford when it made sense and we'll probably sell when it makes sense.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4074204729744127968/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4074204729744127968' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4074204729744127968'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4074204729744127968'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/08/why-i-bought-house.html' title='Why I bought a house'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3342648258241362865</id><published>2008-06-13T14:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-13T17:30:09.904-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='USAA'/><title type='text'>USAA love</title><content type='html'>Joy and I are starting to be serious about buying a house(!), which has added to stress lately.  We probably aren't going to get a great deal, but I think we are close to finding a fair deal on a townhouse.  Now, most of our liquid assets are tied up in retirement accounts, including the IRA that I use for investing in individual stocks mentioned here.  So I called USAA to see what the rules are for withdrawing money for buying a house.  The representative cleared up the questions I had, but also suggested several other products in the softest possible way.  It was like having a conversation with a very knowledgeable friend.  I didn't actually buy anything at that point, but I will in the very near future.  I'd like to see another bank steal my business from USAA.

&lt;pre&gt;
Company          P/V
-------          ---
Canon            86¢ 
Select Comfort   36¢ 
Berkshire        82¢ 
Sally Beauty     59¢ 
First Marblehead 23¢ 
&lt;/pre&gt;
I recently sold Oracle for somewhere between 90¢ and $1 to the dollar.  Cash is always worth $1 to the dollar and I used the same rate for Alberto-Culver, since I haven't put a value on that company.  My composite P/V for the portfolio is roughly 66¢ to the dollar.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort and First Marblehead still seem insanely cheap to me even after slashing my value estimate.  I expect these will be truly outstanding investments for those who purchase today, but both have been classic value traps for me.  (A value trap is an investment that looks cheap, but whose value falls as fast or faster than the price.)  First Marblehead in particular has been a head-scratcher, since it operates in a great business that has been abandoned by other companies due to short-term problems.  Both companies now include a free option on any future growth.
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the value portion of the ratio is my conservative estimate of the present value of all future earnings.  Further, there's no way to know when or if the price will converge on the value, assuming I estimated it correctly.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1925502187455182995/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1925502187455182995' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1925502187455182995'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1925502187455182995'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/05/pricevalue-ratio.html' title='Price/Value ratio'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3768142010204493696</id><published>2008-05-22T12:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-22T17:42:14.647-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>First Marblehead's good day</title><content type='html'>So the analyst who has been talking down First Marblehead for months has &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSBNG23557620080522"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; the company because the negative news is now baked into the stock price.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/the-rich-drink-better-beer-not-more/"&gt;The Rich Drink Better Beer, Not More&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There's a new &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/24625286"&gt;thing called coolspotters&lt;/a&gt; that tracks what products celebrities endorse.
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/podcast-5/"&gt;Consumers are incredibly stingy&lt;/a&gt;, except when it comes to luxury items.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of my investments, I'd say three and a half of them less luxury goods to consumers.  Canon sells top of the line cameras (as well as high-quality point-and-shoots), Sally Beauty sells salon-quality supplies, and Select Comfort sells premium mattresses.  Alberto-Culver has mass market products that are more upscale than average in drug stores and Wal-Mart.  The advantage these companies share is pricing power.  Basically in hard times, like now, they can decide to drop prices a bit to keep up sales volume, or they can wait around until times get better and raise prices.  I have to be honest: I'll probably pay 10% more to get a Canon product over any of the competitors.  It might seem irrational, but I think it's justifiable because I know what I'm going to get and I know I'll be happy.  I'm sure the same is true of women who buy certain brands of shampoo or soap.

(Of course, the market seems irrational when my stocks are going down and I'm a genius when they go up!)  My two biggest losers are priced far below what my DCF models predict they are worth.  First Marblehead is fairly easy to figure, since the company &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=147457&amp;p=irol-projres"&gt;publishes&lt;/a&gt; projected cash flows from its residuals.  If you discount those residuals at 15%, which is greater than the rate management uses to value any of the residual tiers, the stock ought to be trading no less than $6 a share.  That would imply no future business, which is a safe assumption at the moment.  The current price ($3.62) implies a discount rate of 23%, which is what you might be charged for credit card debt if you had a really bad credit score.  Remember, these loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy and were originally made to people with relatively good credit scores.  First Marblehead will almost certainly double in price when the cash from residuals begins rolling in during 2009.  Also, the shares have a built in call option on the possibility business will resume in the future.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort, as a consumer products company that is currently out of favor with consumers, represents a tougher challenge to value.  There's no way to know if the Sleep Number concept has run its course and sales will whither and die.  But if we assume that the company will earn 22¢ in the next 12 months as it did the last 12 months and that earnings will increase a modest 3% forever, you get the current market value.  But there are reasons to expect these assumptions are too modest.  First, the company has finally stopped building new stores and buying back shares, and has cut advertising, staff and other expenses.  Earnings in the future figure to be higher even if sales remain flat.  Second, if the market ever turns Select Comfort would seem poised to capture quite a bit of market share.  It's severely cut back advertising, which has hurt the wholesale and online portions of the business.  When people start buying mattresses again, it should face fewer competitors with less capacity.
&lt;p&gt;
Now these companies have very little risk of becoming worthless and if things go right ought to do very well.  At these prices, simply returning to profitability will provide new investors with great returns.  I've already lost most of my investment in these companies and I can't afford to put more cash into them.  But I will continue to hold them, which is functionally the same as considering them good buys, because the upside remains more likely and more profitable than the downside.

The &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/search/label/ORQDY"&gt;call option&lt;/a&gt; I sold last month was exercised at expiry and was worth 80¢ since Oracle ended the week at $21.80.  Although I lost a little bit on this option, my combined ratio stands at 68.04% for all options written.
&lt;p&gt;
The position I sold over the weekend was purchased a little over a year ago for $16.50, which works out to a 29.32% annualized gain.  The S&amp;P 500 has lost about 1% over the same time.  So that particular trade has been very profitable, as has my Oracle trades in general.  I still believe Oracle is misunderstood, but I believe it is trading near its fair value and I don't think its prospects look particularly good in the next few months.  Eventually, companies will respond to slowing consumer demand by cutting capital spending.  And we have not yet seen the end of bankruptcies even within the financial sector.  Perhaps I will be able to buy back into the company if it misses earnings in the next year or two.  I hope so, because I'm already starting to miss it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3558304501322402080/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3558304501322402080' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3558304501322402080'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3558304501322402080'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-i-sold-off-my-oracle-position.html' title='Why I sold off my Oracle position'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1347785903685491284</id><published>2008-04-09T11:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-09T15:58:04.002-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>More good news and bad news</title><content type='html'>This week, my portfolio had good news and bad news.  The good news is that Canon paid their year end dividend.  Since the exchange rate has fallen to about ¥100 to the dollar, the ¥60 dividend worked out to be 60¢ a share.  Canon's dividend yield is about 2%, but based on my original cost basis, I'm earning closer to 3%.  As long as Canon continues to raise its dividend, I will be happy to hold my shares.
&lt;p&gt;
The bad news was that TERI, the non-profit that First Marblehead uses to insure its loans, declared bankruptcy.  Now I believe the bankruptcy is for technical, not fundamental reasons, and I think the effect on First Marblehead will be very little in the long run.  But my position has been battered to a considerable degree and perhaps permanently.  At the very least, the news makes an immediate recovery very difficult.
&lt;p&gt;
At no time have a felt that First Marblehead was a bad risk/reward proposition at the current price, so in one sense I don't feel I made a mistake.  But I did ignore one of my fundamental sell signals: to get out when a dividend is cut or lowered.  If I'd done that, I would have saved myself a lot of money and aggravation.  Further, there will often be an opportunity to buy the shares back at a later date when I've had a chance to analyze the company independent of the dividend.
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment, this sell signal only applies to Canon and my token position in Alberto-Culver.  Which reminds me: selling Alberto has easily been my most costly decision to date since it freed up cash to buy First Marblehead.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1347785903685491284/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1347785903685491284' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1347785903685491284'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1347785903685491284'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/04/more-good-news-and-bad-news.html' title='More good news and bad news'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6158663088228141298</id><published>2008-03-27T10:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-27T13:20:18.785-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQDY'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Good and bad news for Oracle</title><content type='html'>Oracle had a pretty good third quarter, but not good enough for Wall Street's standards.  Earnings came in at 26¢, which was 6¢ better than the previous year, but 4¢ less than the average analyst prediction.  I don't see anything too surprising about the numbers on first inspection&amp;mdash;there aren't as many companies buying new licenses, but current customers still seem to be paying.  But Oracle's shares fell $1.50 or so this morning.
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, my short call position gained about 75¢ over the same time period, which effectively cushioned half of the loss for me.  Further, the news does not substantially lower my long-term opinion of Oracle's value, though it did reduce the odds I'd get $21 for my shares.  So selling the call option has served my purpose.  Interestingly, the call ought to have served the purpose of whoever bought it as well.  Rather than buying shares and losing $1.50 overnight, the buyer would have lost only 75¢.  And the insurance would have required less cash be tied up than if the shares were bought outright.  Altogether, it was a fair exchange.
&lt;p&gt;
With 22 days remaining before expiration, there the odds the option will be exercised are less than 30%</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6158663088228141298/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6158663088228141298' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6158663088228141298'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6158663088228141298'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/03/good-and-bad-news-for-oracle.html' title='Good and bad news for Oracle'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1747960289431656179</id><published>2008-03-19T10:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-19T11:04:10.662-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQDY'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Why I sold another call option on Oracle</title><content type='html'>I sold a call option on Oracle with a strike price of $21 that expires in April.  I think $21 is near the bottom of Oracle's fair value range and I'm willing to be paid 75¢ for the risk it will be worth more than $21 in a month.  Oracle took a little dive today after I sold the call and the odds that it will be exercised are about 2 in 5 as of right now.  I'll also be happy to get the cash if I need to sell&amp;mdash;Oracle is most nearly fully valued of my positions.

I caught myself wondering if he would be interested in a small, unconventional mattress company based in Minneapolis.  Of course, the entire company is far too small for him to bother with, but as luck would have it, the George Hall (another activist shareholder) has &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827187/000090266408001492/p08-0712sc13d.txt"&gt;targeted Select Comfort&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The letter to Select Comfort lists a number of proposals, which are not terribly radical, but do highlight several management failures.  Most troubling to me are comments about CEO William R. McLaughlin's recent announcement about his salary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Further,  the Chief  Executive Officer's agreement to forgo his base salary until same store sales increase by at least 1% for four  consecutive  weeks,  while good for public  relations,  is inconsistent with shareholder interests,  since improvement of the Company's financial  performance requires a greater length of same store sales  improvement than four weeks.  Further,  this limited, short test allows for alteration of marketing spending in order for the Chief Executive Officer to achieve his limited performance goals, which may have nothing  to  do  with  appropriate   marketing  spending  for  the  Company  and inconsistent  with the  Company  improving  its  annual  financial  performance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Looking at the text of Mr. McLaughlin's &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827187/000082718708000012/exhibit10_1.htm"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, I'm forced to agree with his critics&amp;mdash;he seems to be an untrustworthy manager.  At this point, he has set the bar so low that practically anyone with some business experience can clear it.  I'm afraid I now agree with those who have called for him to resign.
&lt;p&gt;
Reading between lines, implementing SAP seems to have become &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(software_development)"&gt;a death march&lt;/a&gt;.  More money will not solve the problem, so shareholders ought to consider the cost so far to be sunk.  Also, as the letter spells out, the SAP installation is probably overly ambitious for a company like Select Comfort, which may never recoup the savings needed to pay for the system.
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if I agree with the idea that the company should close low performing stores.  The letter suggests returning to the company's direct marketing roots and eliminating the wholesale business.  I think the key to the problem is understanding why some stores are failing.  For instance, it does not seem like stores are getting the advertising coverage they need.  If that's the case, closing the stores might not be the most productive idea.
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I welcome Mr. Hall's investment and I hope management will open up their operation to his input.  An outside pair of eyes can only help.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/318699531086850113/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=318699531086850113' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/318699531086850113'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/318699531086850113'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/03/here-comes-activist.html' title='Here comes the activist'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-857762040237665043</id><published>2008-03-07T13:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-03-11T13:36:25.122-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Portfolio volatility</title><content type='html'>Thanks in part to abysmal performances by First Marblehead and Select Comfort, my portfolio is sinking like a rock.  It has now dropped decisively below two of my favorite benchmarks: Berkshire Hathaway and inflation + 10%.  Worse, I think the official measure of inflation I use is understated and Berkshire is undervalued.  Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 index is "gaining" ground (by dropping less quickly than my IRA), so the recent past has been harsh.
&lt;p&gt;
Nobody likes to be wrong and the standard response to a situation like this would be to say that luck turned against me.  Owning two companies that have been particularly hard hit by the housing and securitization busts might seem like unfortunate timing except that I've bought both companies on the way down knowing the strikes against them.  It's ugly and I can't blame luck.
&lt;p&gt;
The good news would be that I haven't actually lost money on these shares.  Both companies will see their fortunes reverse in a few years.  I expect current prices will seem unimaginable.  Further, there is no particular reason for me to sell these companies until their fair value is reached.  So I need to ignore the stock charts wiggling up and down for the moment.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/857762040237665043/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=857762040237665043' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/857762040237665043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/857762040237665043'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/03/portfolio-volatility.html' title='Portfolio volatility'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7317812524102985211</id><published>2008-02-20T16:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-29T18:17:39.402-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>2007 Look-through earnings</title><content type='html'>As usual, I have to wait for Warren Buffett to release Berkshire's earnings before I can tabulate mine:

I keep track of my IRA like an open-ended mutual fund and this is the look-through earnings per "share" of my IRA "fund".  As I buy and sell stocks, my portion of their  earnings fluctuates and when I add cash, it alters the percentage of portfolio's total value comes from look-through earnings.  So when I sold Oracle shares over the year, I reduced the earnings I give myself credit for and when I bought Select Comfort, I increased my share of earnings.
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks in very large part to Oracle, my look-through results actually improved.  When you add in call option premiums and capital gains on selling shares, my results are even better.  But my relative share of the company has been reduced and I won't get anywhere near those returns in 2008.  
&lt;p&gt;
My two troubled positions look ok in this table, but that is mostly an illusion because I've increased my holdings to a large degree.  In his &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2007ltr.pdf"&gt;just released letter&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Buffett lays out four criteria he looks for in buying a business: "a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term economics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag."  The CEOs First Marblehead and Select Comfort have earned my respect anew by taking voluntary pay cuts for poor results that are largely out of their control.  Also, the stock market has cut share price of these companies from cheap to practically free, in my opinion.  The reason in both cases is largely a result of worsening economic conditions.  In both cases, there are internal changes that need to be made if the companies are going to thrive, but they continue to have advantages compared to competitors that are not likely to disappear.  If I weren't already up to my ears in these companies, I'd be buying at these prices.
&lt;p&gt;
Canon and Berkshire continue to earn about what is to be expected.  They are both too large to grow quickly, but have very wide and clear moats that ought to preserve the businesses for decades to come.  Unlike Oracle, the market has not come close to recognizing these company's intrinsic values, so I have not been tempted to sell.
&lt;p&gt;
Sally Beauty earned very little this year because it has needed to pay so much in interest expenses since splitting with Alberto-Culver.  This year and next ought to be pivotal for the company, so it's very encouraging that directors have &lt;a href="http://www.form4oracle.com/company?cik=0001368458&amp;ticker=sbh"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; $3 million of shares to the $1 million worth they purchased with their own money last year.  When the restrictions on selling agreed to by the principals of the spin-off transaction expire at the end of the year, I expect management will begin to trumpet business growth instead of underplaying it.  I've noticed there are plenty of mom-and-pop beauty supply shops here in Southern California, and I expect there will be plenty of opportunities to consolidate the industry while paying down the debt.
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, 2007 looks similar to what analysts predicted &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/look-through-earnings.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, but that result is misleading because I'm more invested in these stocks than I was at that time.  Looking at operating earnings, which includes various cash returns and costs, shows a fuller picture of my results:
&lt;pre&gt;
Interest    0.01    0.03    0.16    0.01    0.03    0.02    0.00
Dividends   0.00    0.08    0.06    0.08    0.03  
Costs      (0.01)  (0.14)  (0.19)  (0.04)  (0.06)  (0.22)  (0.12)
Arbitrage   0.00    0.50    0.41    
Options     0.07    0.14     
Operating   1.07    1.79    1.37    1.01    0.65    0.32    0.23
Gain      -38.18%  25.76%  35.66%  56.70% 100.59%  41.50% 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm fairly pleased with these results, but I can't expect them to continue into the future.  In particular, I likely will not have any arbitrage earnings this year, since I've invested most of my cash into businesses that I feel are too cheap to pass up and which might not pan out for a few years.  Finally, here are my net results juiced by large realized gains that will not be repeated this year:
&lt;pre&gt;
Realized Gain           2.88                            1.79 
Special dividend                2.99    
Net              1.07   4.60    4.37    1.01    0.65    2.11  0.23
Gain           -76.79%  5.41% 331.08%  56.70% -69.39% 827.21%

&lt;p&gt;
In worse news, Select Comfort has again disappointed shareholders, though it seems the market is overreacting a bit.  Now that it's clear air beds are not immune from recession the way Tempur-Pedic memory foam beds seem to be, no one should be surprised by slowing sales in the quarters ahead.  There is no reason the company can't survive and come back much stronger.  At these prices the risk is minimal and I suspect that recent price drops have more to do with institutions dropping losers and "penny stocks" than real analysis of the business.
&lt;p&gt;
That said, there are some huge opportunities that the company has missed.  Having established their brand and product as legitimate, they should have addressed the question of why buy from them.  The competition, in my opinion, is regional mattress stores and traditional mattresses, not other premium mattresses like Tempur-Pedic.  Now that Select Comfort has established stores all over the country, the network needs to be leveraged.
&lt;p&gt;
Here's my idea for a new ad campaign:
&lt;p&gt;
A sleazy looking salesman in a wrinkled suit is standing in front of a mile of mattresses next to a guy in a bear costume.
&lt;p&gt;
Salesman: Come on down to Miles of Mattresses!  If we can't get you the cheapest bed, I'll wrassle this bear!
&lt;p&gt;
The picture jumps and slows down as if it were on a film projector that is starting to die.  The scene fades to a clean Select Comfort store with three beds or so and a clean-cut salesman in a polo shirt and slacks.  There might be another salesman helping a couple try out the bed in the background, but the store should not look cluttered.
&lt;p&gt;
Spokesman: Why buy an outdated spring mattress that needs to be flipped every year?  Springs start to sag after a while in cheap mattresses and become uncomfortable.  Select Comfort sells only modern Sleep Number beds that support sleepers with their exclusive adjustable air chambers.  And unlike foam or water beds that are difficult to move, the a Sleep Number bed can be emptied and packed in a matter of minutes.  Why buy from this guy, when you can sleep on a layer of air for a lot less than you might think.  Come to one of our X locations in Y.
&lt;p&gt;
As the spokesman talks, cut to the standard "pressure point and support" image or, if there are customers in the store, show them adjusting the bed to minimize pressure.  When the spokesman says, "this guy", cut to the salesman and bear wrestling or cycling each other.  Finally cut to a map of the Y region with X stores clearly marked.
&lt;p&gt;
These ads should be short, well produced and run constantly.  They need to be shown in the cheaper time-slots at night, during the day, and on weekends so that they get seen by people who are ready to buy a new bed.  Hopefully everyone who has a TV will see them at least occasionally.  I think retail partners are a mistake unless Select Comfort has no locations in a region, and even then, they should make sure the retailer's ads put Sleep Number beds in a good light.
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think the financials are nearly as bad as they appear, especially if you allow for a recession.  I also don't think it will be too hard to turn this ship around.  In fact, I think they are one good TV spot away from returning to high growth, since they have cultivated a number of advantages over regular beds.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/147819010992859019/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=147819010992859019' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/147819010992859019'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/147819010992859019'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/02/portfolio-news.html' title='Portfolio news'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2804483809120713902</id><published>2008-02-08T12:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-08T12:22:28.572-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TPX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BEAS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Portfolio news</title><content type='html'>First, Footnoted.org has some details on the &lt;a href="http://www.footnoted.org/urge-to-merge/the-merger-back-story-at-beas/"&gt;Oracle/BEA merger&lt;/a&gt; and gave First Marblehead a &lt;a href="http://www.footnoted.org/gold-stars/more-cause-and-effect-at-first-marblehead/"&gt;gold star&lt;/a&gt;.

There wasn't a plan&amp;mdash;I just started with a small amount of cash and didn't want to spend too much proportionally on commissions.  As I put more money into my account, I simply picked the best option available at the time.  So I've bought Oracle twice, Canon twice, Select Comfort three times, First Marblehead three times, and Alberto-Culver/Sally Beauty twice.  At the time, I thought these were the best purchases I could make.
&lt;p&gt;
Note that these were the best purchases for me.  With only a handful of companies in a portfolio, it's vital to actually understand how they make money and why they might be cheap.

According to my calculations, the current liquidation or run-off value of the company is $9.80 a share.  That number assumes shares will be diluted 20% according to the Goldman Sachs deal.  Then I calculated a conservative guess of the company's value assuming it is able to return to some sort of stable business.  I'm guessing the company is worth $38 or more if they are able to convert some of their loans on the balance sheet into earnings.  Note that I'm not assuming they will get the same sort of securitization deals they received a year ago&amp;mdash;just that they find buyers or financing to turn their loans into earnings at some point.
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I think this whole crisis will blow over in a year or two and Marblehead and Sallie Mae will survive as a bunch of competitors will disappear.  As survivors, their earnings power will dramatically increase and $38 will seem laughably cheap.  But for the sake of argument, let's use that number.  I also expect survival has a better than 90% chance, since Goldman Sachs has a stake in the company.  But to prove the point, I'll assume the survival odds are 50%.  My expected price, therefor, is $24 and my Kelly ratio is 39%.  So I bought more shares at $14.95 to boost my First Marblehead position and reduce it's cost basis.
&lt;p&gt;
In my opinion, First Marblehead will be able to continue as a going concern whether or not it is able to securitize loans.  Those loans will provide consistent, high-return cash flow to someone over the next few decades, so someone will buy them or finance Marblehead to keep them.  It's not dissimilar from Microsoft shifting from selling shrink-wrap software to collecting service reviews.  Either way they are selling something valuable and it's just a matter of how to collect profits.  So this purchase is not a bet on the securitization market, but a bet on First Marblehead's business.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8030308229585405244/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8030308229585405244' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8030308229585405244'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8030308229585405244'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/02/why-i-bought-yet-more-first-marblehead.html' title='Why I bought yet more First Marblehead'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5067713319106293974</id><published>2008-01-28T14:11:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-01T11:53:16.960-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Four types of moats</title><content type='html'>Recently on the Motley Fool, there was &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/01/15/i-like-big-moats-and-i-cannot-lie.aspx?terms=big+moats&amp;vstest=search_042607_linkdefault"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; highlighting four different moat types:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economies of scale
&lt;li&gt;The network effect
&lt;li&gt;Intellectual-property rights
&lt;li&gt;High switching costs
&lt;/ol&gt;
Personally, I'd divide IP rights into: patents/secrets and brands, which is to say: what you know and what your customers know.  Also, economies of scale and network effect are really two sides of the same coin.  Size can give a company advantages or it can give customers advantages or both.  I think high switching cost has an analogue as well: monopoly.  Regulated monopolies are especially impervious to assault. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economies of scale
&lt;li&gt;The network effect
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectual-property rights
&lt;li&gt;Brand
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stickiness
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopoly
&lt;li&gt;High switching costs
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
In each case, the moat is developed by created an advantage that other companies can't steal.  Bigger companies, like bigger ancient cities, are more likely to have established moats.  For instance Oracle, Canon and Berkshire Hathaway have multiple and deep moats in nearly every category.  First Marblehead mostly fends off competition with intellectual property.  I'm worried that Select Comfort might have lost their primary moat&amp;mdash;their brand.  Those are much smaller companies that have not completely staked out their territory.
&lt;p&gt;
So for smaller, fast-growing companies, the question is what moats can they develop?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5067713319106293974/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5067713319106293974' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5067713319106293974'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5067713319106293974'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/four-types-of-moats.html' title='Four types of moats'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4343201498774695504</id><published>2008-01-22T12:27:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-23T09:36:40.083-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='PTTRX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>Yield curve strategy nears turning point</title><content type='html'>When the Federal Reserve knocked short-term rates down 3/4%, I took at look at the current yield curve to see if it has become attractive.

&lt;p&gt;
The Total Return fund returned 9.07% last year compared to 5.49% for the S&amp;amp;P 500 with dividends invested.  That's pretty good, but I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/01/why-im-buying-pimco-total-return-bond.html"&gt;made the call&lt;/a&gt; about a year too early.  The S&amp;amp;P 500 was up 15.80% in 2006 compared to just 4.0% for PIMCO.  So far this year, the index is down 9.67% and the bond fund is up  2.66%, so I'm not complaining about being early.  In fact, I think the nature of the yield curve signal requires an early switch when the curve becomes inverted.
&lt;p&gt;
As we saw today, the Federal Reserve controls the short end of the yield curve.  When it wants to stimulate the economy, it pushes down rates and tries to raise them when the economy seems to be functioning well.  Market forces controls the long end of the curve.  Since there is little default risk in US bonds, the market mostly concerns itself with beating inflation over the life of the bond.  In general, the longer the bond the more yield investors demand to compensate for inflation risk over the life of the bond.  Since inflation and economic activity are closely related, you could rephrase those goals so that the Federal Reserve is fighting inflation and the bond market is predicting future economic activity, but I think that's overly complicated.  
&lt;p&gt;
Under normal circumstances, the curve slopes up as the term of the bond increases.  When the short-term rates go up because the economy is functioning well, the long-term rates go up too because of an increased expectation of inflation.  On the other hand, when the economy is in trouble, there isn't as much inflation to fear in the future.  So there is something strange going on when the curve is inverted.  Specifically, the Federal Reserve thinks the economy is doing fine and the bond market isn't worried about inflation, which seems like the best of all worlds&amp;mdash;the so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks"&gt;Goldilocks&lt;/a&gt; economy.
&lt;p&gt;
And for a while, it is the best of all worlds as the economy hums along with no sign of rising prices.  But it also means that most people let down their guard against "bad things".  There is also an inherent risk that people will borrow long and loan short to profit off of the inversion.  When the curve snaps back to normal, the profit vanishes and the position becomes an expensive liability.  Leverage will increases the pain.  You might think this only happens to hedge funds and Wall Street types, but how many stories have you heard recently about people taking money out of their home's equity to buy cars or go on vacation?  One of the reasons people were willing to do that sort of thing was that borrowing against home equity was so cheap and easy.
&lt;p&gt;
So an inverted yield curve marks the moment when everything is working about as well as can be expected and conventional wisdom says there is nothing to be worried about.  And there isn't until suddenly, there is a lot to worry about.  The Federal Reserve responds to economic trouble by pushing down the short end while the market responds to future inflation by demanding more yield on the long end.  When we see a normal to steep curve, the fear permeates the economy and it's time to switch from bonds to stocks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4343201498774695504/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4343201498774695504' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4343201498774695504'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4343201498774695504'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/yield-curve-strategy-nears-turning.html' title='Yield curve strategy nears turning point'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4853583303650180040</id><published>2008-01-16T13:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-16T15:57:52.114-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SNE'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='NTDOY'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MSFT'/><title type='text'>The Wii effect</title><content type='html'>I've very late to the game (so to speak) and I've never played a Wii, but I'm very interested in how it succeeded in the face of stiff competition from Microsoft and Sony.

I go to the mound in the 1st inning planning to pitch a perfect game.  If they get a hit, then I am throwing a one-hitter.  If they get a walk, it's my last walk.  I deal with perfection to the point that it's logical to conceive it.  History is history, the future is perfect. &amp;mdash; Orel Hershiser
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having become throughly depressed by my IRA's 2007 results, I thought it would be a good idea to look at the long-term results again:
&lt;pre&gt;
Date      S&amp;P 500   Delta     IRA   Delta   BRK A
06/23/02     
12/31/02  -11.37%  42.32%  30.95%  30.18%   0.76%
12/31/03   26.38%  -1.49%  24.89%   9.08%  15.81%
12/31/04    8.99%  -2.16%   6.84%   2.49%   4.34%
12/31/05    3.00%   3.23%   6.23%   5.42%   0.81%
12/31/06   13.62%  14.88%  28.50%   4.39%  24.11%
12/31/07    3.53% -16.83% -13.30% -42.04%  28.74%
01/11/08   -4.59%  -0.66%  -5.24%   1.47%  -6.71%
Total Gain 41.13%  54.81%  95.94%  12.98%  82.96%
Annualized  6.40%   6.47%  12.87%   1.38%  11.49%
&lt;/pre&gt;
While 2007 was a very rough year and 2008 is not looking much better so far, my 5 1/2 year performance is still 6%+ better than the S&amp;P 500 and 1%+ better than if I'd just bought Berkshire Hathaway shares.  Big years early on have saved my IRA from under-performance.  The current bear market will be a test on my portfolio and my willingness to deal with loss.
&lt;p&gt;
To tie in the Oral Hershiser quote: mistakes (and successes) in the past are no longer important to what must be done in the future.  Rather than beat myself up over past mistakes, I need to focus on what I can do to maximize my future success.  If that means selling some investments at a loss to buy another investment with better potential returns, so be it.  As it happens, I still believe in my current investments, so I don't plan on doing anything drastic.  Over the long run, I hope my decisions to be shown correct.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3509781417009716551/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3509781417009716551' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3509781417009716551'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3509781417009716551'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/long-term-results.html' title='Long-term results'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8264437479870504521</id><published>2008-01-07T13:48:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-10T17:17:48.315-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>I think I understand the Goldman deal</title><content type='html'>After listening to the conference call and reading the press release and SEC documents, I think I understand the logic of First Marblehead's deal with Goldman Sachs.  Recall that when I bought the company, it needed to securitize the loans it helped originate in order to make money.  The banks that originally fund the loans only paid the cost of the loan processing in exchange for agreeing to securitize through First Marblehead.  As a result, the business model was heavily backloaded and dependent on investors to buy asset-backed securities.
&lt;p&gt;
By the end of 2007, the market for all sorts of asset-backed securities had dried up to the point where First Marblehead was not able to sell the loans it helped originate.  As a consequence, the banks originating the loans were able to start charging a penalty to Marblehead (a risk I did not fully understand).  This left the company in a bind.  It could stop originating loans until the market for them cleared up, losing ground to better capitalized companies.  Or it could keep making loans hoping they could be sold before running out of capital.  Neither choice was very palatable, though curtailing originations was clearly less risky.
&lt;p&gt;
Apparently, GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and First Marblehead "executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 13, 2007", which means they had been considering some sort of deal for half a year.  We can't know what the deal would have looked like at that point, but since the confidentiality agreement was signed by a "global, diversified fund dedicated to making privately negotiated equity investments" (according to its &lt;a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our_firm/media_center/articles/current_press_releases_article_070423155618.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;), we can be pretty sure it would have been a privately negotiated equity investments similar to the one that was finally agreed upon.  Of course the terms would have been more favorable in July than they were in December. 
&lt;p&gt;
It's possible First Marblehead saw the writing on the wall last summer and was ready to sell an equity share in order to get access to a warehouse facility like it got in December.  That would open up options in the event secuitization stalled for a quarter or two.  Alternatively, it might have facilitated keeping a portion of loans on the books for one reason or another.  But there can be no doubt that what First Marblehead wanted, and what the Goldman Sachs fund could provide, was access to capital.  So the plan was to begin shifting from the nearly capital-free business model to one that was more capital intensive.
&lt;p&gt;
I think the reason the Goldman deal did not go through during the summer is that it wouldn't have looked good to investors or to clients.  Low capital requirements made the company a very attractive investment since cash flows could be diverted to dividends and buybacks.  It also created an opportunities for First Marblehead's banking clients, who provided capital to originate the loans.  So it would have been difficult to sell this deal in July when business looked pretty good.
&lt;p&gt;
By December, when it was clear the business was in trouble, the deal could be seen as a baleout, not a sellout.  Whether or not it would have been better to just do the deal over the summer is water under the bridge&amp;mdash;the real question is was it worth doing in the winter.  And given the choice between stepping out of the student loan business or selling an equity share of the company to keep going, there is a strong case to be made for the later, especially if the plan was in the works already.
&lt;p&gt;
To make the case, let's look at First Marblehead's growth history:
&lt;pre&gt;
Fiscal     2007    2006    2005    2004    2003    2002    2001    2000
Revenues  54.61%  34.83% 109.76% 118.11% 121.42% 511.06%  70.08%  72.38%
Earnings  57.37%  47.78% 112.12% 138.96% 157.58% 487.37%  
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now for the sake of argument, assume that without the deal, First Marblehead will lose money for a quarter or two (their Q2 and Q3), and then make enough in the final quarter to be flat on the year.  Q1 revenue, which traditionally accounts for a third of the annual total, was up 24% and earnings were up almost 20% from the previous year, so this scenario seems possible.  In 2009, we'll assume growth jumps back to 35%, so that earnings are up a total of 35% over two years.  I made this scenario as aggressive as seemed reasonable, since it's the one I'm arguing against.
&lt;p&gt;
With the deal, we can assume loan volume growth will be close to the 35% we saw in 2006 because there's no evidence student borrowing is slowing down.  Q2 will still be a losing quarter and depending on how the accounting works Q3 might be too.  But when the market for ABS opens, First Marblehead will have a lot of inventory saved up.  We don't know exactly when securitization might start up again, but let's suppose it takes through the end of 2009 to work through the backlog.  Two years of 35% growth works out to about 82% total growth compared to 35% without the deal.
&lt;p&gt;
Presumably, the securitizations will be less profitable with the deal, because warehousing the loans racks up interest charges.  And of course, you have to factor in the 20% share of the company First Marblehead needed to give up.  Obviously, there are risks added as well.  But its hard to argue against diluting shares 20% over two years to get 47% better growth over the same period.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8264437479870504521/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8264437479870504521' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8264437479870504521'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8264437479870504521'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/i-think-i-understand-goldman-deal.html' title='I think I understand the Goldman deal'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7273730286257156346</id><published>2008-01-02T00:19:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-01-05T02:20:02.729-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='N'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>2007 Year in review</title><content type='html'>On the last day of 2007, my IRA ended the year down 13.3%, which was the first down year I've had and substantially worse than my benchmarks, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway.  These things happen and especially with an ultra-concentrated portfolio.  Here are my core positions:
&lt;pre&gt;
Stock               2007 Return
-----               -----------
Alberto-Culver      20.83%
Berkshire Hathaway  29.19%
Canon              -17.74%
First Marblehead   -87.43%
Oracle              34.23%
Sally Beauty        16.03%
Select Comfort     -57.70%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort has been the biggest disappointment of my short investment career. I certainly misjudged the business though I still think my initial purchase was a good decision.  I now believe my follow-on purchase last year was a mistake, because I did not recognize the danger of air mattresses becoming a commodity.  Select Comfort is built from the ground up to be a specialty bedding company, so if it ever needs to compete on price, quality and service alone, it must be revalued.  That said, I think the current price is actually less than what the company would be worth as a commodity manufacturer.  So any future turn-around comes as a free option at prices less than about $7 a share.  As I mentioned when I made my third purchase, I plan to aggressively sell covered call options until the future becomes more clear.
&lt;p&gt;
First Marblehead has always looked stunningly cheap to me.  Incredibly, the price has dropped to just over book value because of worsening conditions in the student loan paper market.  Basically the market assumed for a while that the company would just close up shop.  Since the supply (or from the perspective of students, the demand) of private student loans is growing at breakneck speed, walking away from the business would be crazy.  Instead, First Marblehead has entered into &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/12/27/marbleheads-golden-opportunity.aspx"&gt;an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Goldman Sachs that will allow it to hold the loans it currently sells off in exchange for nearly 17% of the company's equity.  I haven't had time to dig into the details of the deal yet, but it does seem like First Marblehead simultaneously removed short-term risk, reshaped its business model, and bought a powerful ally with a vested interest in its success.  Buying more shares is a definite possibility, though I don't like the message sent by the dividend cut.
&lt;p&gt;
Canon became cheaper in part because of a delayed entry into the TV business due to patent problems.  In the meantime, the company's core camera and printer products have sold well and profitably, and it is working on other entries into the display business.  The dividend for 2007 was raised another 10% without seriously eating into cash flows.  Canon's dividend is important because it is a signal from management that the business is doing well and it provides me with another reason to keep holding.  Based solely on the dividend, Canon is trading below its fair value.
&lt;p&gt;
Outside of these three stocks, my investments performed quite well.  Unfortunately, my losers made up a larger portion of the portfolio than the winners did.  Options and arbitrage transactions worked extremely well for me on the whole, but I'd have to dramatically increase my trading activity to come close to making up for any one of the losing positions.  On the other hand, my returns would undeniably be worse without these small, short-term, trading successes.  Along the same lines, Alberto-Culver helped, but is a portion of my portfolio too tiny to profitably sell.  Its performance barely matters.
&lt;p&gt;
Sally Beauty meets my current expectations.  Everything seems quiet at the moment, but that will change as the company pays down debt and the restrictions on insider sales expire over the next year or so.  I'm contemplating increasing my exposure in what amounts to a publicly-traded, private-equity investment (if you can imagine).
&lt;p&gt;
I'm in the process of wishing Oracle, my first and most successful investment, a fond farewell.  On an annualized basis, my return on shares sold in 2007 has been over 20%.  I've decided to end this investment because I believe the company is trading at a fair value.  For the last few months it seems that Larry Ellison agrees with me as he has been exercising options for and selling a million shares a day.  He has plenty of shares left to keep his financial future firmly tied to the company he founded, but I'm guessing he is more excited about other investments such as NetSuite.  I'll keep my eye on the price in case it falls below its fair value again, however.
&lt;p&gt;
Berkshire Hathaway remains the anchor of my portfolio for the foreseeable future.  This year will almost certainly be the moment when the company can finally use its dry powder.  There are certainly plenty of quality assets available for pennies on the dollar due to "lack of liquidity" (i.e., over-leveraged entities that can no longer refinance).  No doubt we will see some buys in the months to come.
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps I'm foolish, but I feel fairly optimistic about 2008.  Besides Select Comfort, the portfolio has improved financially and the businesses are stronger than ever.  I have no urgency to sell until the future becomes clear, so the market price isn't all that important in the short run.  Further, lower prices for stocks in general ought to present me with better opportunities for future purchases.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/7273730286257156346/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=7273730286257156346' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7273730286257156346'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7273730286257156346'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2008/01/2007-year-in-review.html' title='2007 Year in review'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8271247874801710416</id><published>2007-12-14T09:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-14T14:06:01.154-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TPX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Why I bought  yet more Select Comfort</title><content type='html'>This might be a mistake.  Yesterday, when I wrote the post on Select Comfort's problems, I got angry.  The market is completely hammering this company and it has gotten out of hand.  Every DCF model I use suggests the market is pricing in zero growth&amp;mdash;forever!  Now if we were talking about First Marblehead, I suppose I could see how that might happen.  The student loan business depends on a complex web of legal, political, financial, and societal conditions.  If any one of these change, the business could cease to be profitable.  But Select Comfort sells mattresses.  People will always need them.
&lt;p&gt;
Right at this moment, people aren't buying mattresses.  Or to be more accurate, people aren't buying mattresses unless they are really cheap or have Tempur-Pedic on the label.  I think that's for exactly the same reason that houses in Bel-Aire are selling at record prices, but aren't selling at all in other parts of Los Angeles unless the price is rock bottom.  Rich people haven't been hurt by inflation, housing prices, and risky loans the way the rest of us have, so they can buy premium products.  I blame Select Comfort's management for not adjusting to the current reality, but I don't think they can screw this up so badly that sales won't come back in a year or two.
&lt;p&gt;
While we are on the topic, management has screwed up lately, but the results of the past year ought to shake them up and get them focused on the right things.  From the business update this week, I think it has.  To me, it was outstanding news that they refused to give guidance for the rest of this year or next.  Wall Street hates that, but if management can't be sure what is going to happen, they really ought to stay quiet.  Hopefully they have permanently stepped off of the beat-the-numbers game.
&lt;p&gt;
My purchase at $6.50 today increased my share count by a third, but only increased my cost basis by a sixth.  I intend to aggressively sell call options on my shares in order to create a synthetic dividend.  Maybe this isn't rational, but I think the market is mis-valuing Select Comfort and I want to capture some of that difference.  I guess another way to put it is that the market is pricing Select Comfort as if it will screw everything up from now on and I think the odds are low that will happen.  So I'm adding to my position.  But I'm not so sure the market is wrong that I'm willing to take on more downside risk without getting paid.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8271247874801710416/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8271247874801710416' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8271247874801710416'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8271247874801710416'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/why-i-bought-yet-more-select-comfort.html' title='Why I bought  yet more Select Comfort'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-720657480319368966</id><published>2007-12-13T13:37:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-14T08:54:06.553-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='COST'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GE'/><title type='text'>Select Comfort not getting any better</title><content type='html'>Select Comfort gave a brief overview of 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Quarter results and there is very little to like about them.  The current advertising isn't working except for specials and sales.  When a sale ends, the stores lose significant traffic.  Worse, the company will be raising prices in January to cover increased materials prices.  The last year and a half has been miserably poor for shareholders.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm listening to &lt;i&gt;Winning&lt;/i&gt; by Jack Welch and it opened my eyes to where Select Comfort is going wrong.  Traditionally, mattresses are a commodity business.  According to Mr. Welch, there are only three things a commodity producer can change: a) price, b) quality, and c) service.  Like the NASA mantra (cheaper, better, faster), you can only choose two.  So, for instance, at Costco, you get price and quality (= value), but no service.  At a traditional mattress store, you get more service, but sacrifice either quality or price.  Until recently, Select Comfort was able to side-step that game because they had an innovative product that differentiated itself by being a completely separate category&amp;mdash;adjustable mattresses.
&lt;p&gt;
This past year, other companies began to invade the category.  I noticed that advertisers have started using phrases like "select your level of comfort" that are right out of Select Comfort's play book.  Costco now sells mattress very similar to the Sleep Number bed.  Further, other technologies such as memory foam are becoming mainstream.  In other words, the air mattress is now a commodity.
&lt;p&gt;
Now there are two choices for the company: shift to a commodity strategy or find some other way to innovate.  Now we don't know what direction management will take but I think we have some clues.  Last month, Select Comfort hired a new Chief Marketing Office, Catherine Bur-Hall.  Before that, Ms. Hall was a Vice President of Marketing at &lt;a href="http://www.midasprinting.com/visionandmission.htm"&gt;Midas Printing&lt;/a&gt;.  Printing is even more of a commodity business than mattresses and from what I can tell, the Hong Kong company has focused on quality and service as its strategy.  If it's going to be a commodity, those are the areas Select Comfort is likely to have greatest strength.
&lt;p&gt;
When I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-bought-more-select-comfort-on.html"&gt;last bought&lt;/a&gt; this company, I made a mistake.  I thought their product had a sustainable advantage that could be exploited for years to come.  I thought they owned enough mind-share to propel the brand forward with a few tweaks to the advertising.  I think management made the same mistake.  The cost in terms of market value has been substantial and I think the board needs to hold management responsible.
&lt;p&gt;
But the market has clearly over-reacted.  At $6.63, earnings would need to shrink by 5% or so over the next ten years in order to be justified.  Given more reasonable growth rates, the price should be $15 to $18 a share.  The market is assuming that not only will Select Comfort become a commodity business, but it will also fail to be competitive.  Those are far from certain in my opinion.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/720657480319368966/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=720657480319368966' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/720657480319368966'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/720657480319368966'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/select-comfort-not-getting-any-better.html' title='Select Comfort not getting any better'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-123823806411605190</id><published>2007-12-12T08:54:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-12T09:31:11.488-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CNFL'/><title type='text'>Citizens Financial Corporation shares cashed out</title><content type='html'>My shares of Citizens Financial Corporation were cashed out at $7.25 this morning.

For instance, Whitney Tilson highlighted the company in his most recent Financial Times &lt;a href="http://tilsonfunds.com/Look-beyond-generalisations-FT-12-9-07.pdf"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.  In general the gist of these opinions is that while student loan backed bonds might not be selling well right now, the longterm outlook of the industry is quite bright.  Further, Marblehead has been tainted at least somewhat unfairly by the mortgage backed security brush.
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, however, is that all of us are excited about First Marblehead's value mostly because of the research done by &lt;a href="http://bankstocks.com/"&gt;Tom Brown&lt;/a&gt;.  He could very well be wrong on this stock and so would all of us who have followed his analysis.  So rather than having a diversity of opinion, value investors might be trapped by group think.  On the other hand, Wall Street analysts seem to be trapped on the other side by &lt;a href="http://bankstocks.com/article.asp?type=1&amp;id=9881569"&gt;Matt Snowling's research&lt;/a&gt;.  One side is going to be shown correct and for the moment, my money is on Mr. Brown.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5640948260323180072/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5640948260323180072' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5640948260323180072'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5640948260323180072'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/more-opinions-on-first-marblehead.html' title='More opinions on First Marblehead'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3216072467873972146</id><published>2007-12-07T14:57:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-07T16:29:52.945-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>First Marblehead cuts its dividend</title><content type='html'>Finally some bad news from First Marblehead to justify its massive price drop.  Here is the key paragraph from the press release:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Due to uneconomic terms in the current capital markets, we have elected not to securitize private student loans this quarter. We are exploring non-securitization and securitization alternatives for future quarters to enhance our business model and provide long-term capacity to the private student loan market in a manner that benefits our shareholders. Our business volumes remain strong and we see many opportunities to facilitate and process private student loans," said Jack Kopnisky, Chief Executive Officer and President of The First Marblehead Corporation. "Our Board of Directors determined it was prudent to continue to return capital to our shareholders this quarter even during these challenging times."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cutting the dividend is pretty close to a cardinal sin in my book, but I'm not ready to dump my shares yet.  For one thing, the stock has dropped faster than the dividend, so the shares are still undervalued.  For another, it isn't clear to me that this is a real cut.  A year ago the dividend was 12¢ a share, which is what it will be this quarter too.  Further, the press release makes the cut sound temporary and tied to the failure to securitize loans this quarter.  If so, First Marblehead's earnings might be pushed into next year rather than cut off.
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think I've made a mistake here since I don't try to pretend to predict the market for privately placed bonds that Marblehead operates in.  Clearly their raw material (student loans) are available in abundance, but customers (investors) are reluctant to buy.  The good news is that these loans are probably higher quality than most others on the market so when buyers return, they will look at FMD bonds first.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3216072467873972146/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3216072467873972146' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3216072467873972146'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3216072467873972146'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/first-marblehead-cuts-its-dividend.html' title='First Marblehead cuts its dividend'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6877895621150550891</id><published>2007-12-06T09:07:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-06T09:33:37.942-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>A losing year</title><content type='html'>2007 will almost certainly be a losing year for me.  Here's where I stand as of this morning:
&lt;pre&gt;
Date       S&amp;P 500   Delta     IRA   Delta   BRK A
12/06/07      5.27% -10.95%  -5.68% -39.97%  34.28%
Total Gain   50.40%  74.55% 124.95%  20.38% 104.57%
Annualized    7.77%   8.25%  16.01%   2.00%  14.01%
&lt;/pre&gt;
Remember that I own Berkshire stock, so part of my portfolio is supported by this year's 34% gain.  Berkshire is now well above the "inflation +10%" benchmark since the opening of my IRA.  Select Comfort and First Marblehead have cost my portfolio the majority of the underperformance its experienced this year.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort has not performed well in over a year in business terms.  I think the company has been disproportionally impacted by the housing slump and management has made some disastrous mistakes.  At this point, however, the market seriously undervalues the company even after accounting for very real degradation of fundamentals.  There's no guarantee management will right the ship, but Wall Street is treating the mattress retailer as if it has no upside.  I made a mistake by not selling a year ago, but I would be a buyer at this price if I didn't already own shares.
&lt;p&gt;
First Marblehead, which is down another 8% today, has not had any business problems to speak of and has plummeted almost from the moment I bought it.  This is pretty clearly a case of Wall Street blinded by the company's association with other, more troubled financial stocks.  As I've been pointing out, unless there is fraud we haven't heard about, this stock should not trade less than $30 a share.  My hope now is that the low prices stick around until the next few dividends can be reinvested for me.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6877895621150550891/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6877895621150550891' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6877895621150550891'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6877895621150550891'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/losing-year.html' title='A losing year'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3366638010949964241</id><published>2007-12-05T13:09:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-05T17:02:27.401-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Business of charities</title><content type='html'>The end of the year is always the most important in terms of charitable giving, so I think I'll take a moment to look at what makes a charity worth giving to.  First, you need to look at a charity qualitatively and then quantitatively.  In other words, no matter how efficient a charity is financially, there's no point in giving to it if you don't support the cause or the way the charity pursues it.  For instance, I'm fairly ambivalent about animal causes (I think we should focus on people first) so I wouldn't consider giving to one.  And I don't much like PETA's tactics, so I definitely would avoid them even though they are fairly efficient about getting money to their cause.
&lt;p&gt;
I am interested in International Christian organizations, such as &lt;a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4423"&gt;Samaritan's Purse&lt;/a&gt;.  The link is to Charity Navigator, which rates the financial statements of charities.  More about that in a minute.  Two of my favorite programs are &lt;a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/OCC.asp?MPGID=1"&gt;Operation Christmas Child&lt;/a&gt;, which let's donors give a shoe box of gifts to a poor child, and &lt;a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/MPGroup_Index.asp?MPGID=6"&gt;community development programs&lt;/a&gt;, that help people become self-sufficient.  Qualitatively, it's a great organization, but what about the finances?
&lt;p&gt;
From a financial perspective, a charity isn't much different than a for-profit business.  There are revenues, expenses, and a bottom line&amp;mdash;only the bottom line is used to support some cause rather than owners or shareholders.  The first expense, is fundraising, which corresponds to the cost of goods and services in a traditional business.  Charity Navigator looks at this expense in two ways: as a percentage of expenses and as a percentage of revenues.  Normally these are pretty close to the same ratio, but some charities spend more or less then they take in which causes one ratio to be higher than the other.  In both cases the better charities will spend less on fundraising.  Samaritan's Purse spends about 4¢ to raise a dollar of support and 6% of its expenses are related to fundraising.  An excess of $67,924,383 accounts for the discrepancy.
&lt;p&gt;
It's important to compare apples to apples when you look at finances.  For instance, every time there is a disaster in the news, the Red Cross gets a ton of free advertising.  Meanwhile, my wife is the fundraising coordinator for a small pregnancy clinic that gets no government support.  They hold a fundraising banquet every year that generates significant donations, but also costs a fair amount to put on.  Comparing those charities by any objective measure isn't really sensible.  In general, bigger charities and those with notable brands do better than others.
&lt;p&gt;
The next major expense is Administrative, which most correlates with operating expenses in the corporate world.  As a percentage of expenses, the smaller the better.  Samaritan's Purse spends about 5% on administering its programs, which means (after backing out fundraising) 89% of its expenses are directly related to programs.  As a result, it has an excellent efficiency rating from Charity Navigator.  I should point out that these measures of efficiency are closely tied and programs could be rated on what percentage of expenses are directly linked to programs with out losing too much information.
&lt;p&gt;
Besides efficiency, Charity Navigator also quantifies what it calls capacity based on revenue growth, program expenses growth, and working capital ratio.  Roughly speaking, the faster a charity grows and the larger its ready reserve, the more people it will be able to help in the future.  Again, its important to consider the context of a charity.  Larger charities tend to have advantages in terms of growth and reserves.  Samaritan's Purse's revenue has grown 24%, its programs 16% and it has about 5 months of working capital saved up for emergencies.
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I like to donate to &lt;a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=697"&gt;small charities&lt;/a&gt; that I have some personal connection to.  For instance, my wife and I support several missionaries who are our friends.  These small gifts have a much bigger impact than if we gave to larger organizations.  We also think about how to get our contribution to the organizations we support as efficiently as possible.  Usually, writing a check will help more than giving a credit card number to a telemarketer.  Finally, we don't give to every charity that sounds good.  Concentration helps keep costs down and increases the impact we can make.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3366638010949964241/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3366638010949964241' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3366638010949964241'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3366638010949964241'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/business-of-charities.html' title='Business of charities'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4061939835822195277</id><published>2007-12-05T09:12:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-05T10:16:46.737-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>First Marblehead just got cheaper</title><content type='html'>Well, another analyst has downgraded First Marblehead, which has caused the shares to fall once again.  The downgrade hinges on a review of 16 notes by Moody's:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ratings review is prompted by worse than expected performance of the underlying student loans.  In particular, loans originated through the direct-to-consumer channel appear to default at a significantly higher rate compared to loans originated through school financial aid offices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also, it appears the company will not securitize any more loans this year, which pushes earnings into next.
&lt;p&gt;
Now there is no doubt that earnings in the short term will be hurt if the ratings of these notes are reduced and there is no further securitization this year.  And I am troubled that direct-to-consumer loans, which are the most profitable for Marblehead, are the culprits.  But none of these things are likely to be long-term problems for the company.  As long as the dividend does not get cut (and considering cash flow, I don't see how it could), the company trades at least 2/3 of its fair value.  Since I plan on reinvesting my dividends for years to come, today is actually good news.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4061939835822195277/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4061939835822195277' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4061939835822195277'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4061939835822195277'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/first-marblehead-just-got-cheaper.html' title='First Marblehead just got cheaper'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1462622213642683514</id><published>2007-12-04T10:42:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-04T17:11:20.499-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Praising with faint damnation</title><content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;
An analyst downgraded shares of Oracle Corp. late Monday, saying a slowdown in spending on software by companies may pressure its earnings.
&lt;p&gt;
JMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens downgraded the business-software maker to "Market Outperform" from "Strong Buy" and lowered his price target to $23 from $24.
&lt;p&gt;
"While we still believe Oracle will outperform the software industry, our due diligence suggests Oracle's business is slowing along with enterprise software spending," Walravens said in a client note.
&lt;p&gt;
JMP conducted a survey of 38 businesses across the economy and 61 percent said their software spending would stay the same or fall in 2008, he said.
&lt;p&gt;
"This survey result is the worst we have had since 2001 and is similar to the result in May 2003, which marked the beginning of a two- to three-year choppy period for Oracle's business," Walravens said.
&lt;p&gt;
Business in the Americas may be the slowest, he said, and should be helped by performance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Yet the slowing North American unit may make the company's forecast conservative, Walravens said. He lowered his 2008 earnings forecast to $1.21 per share from $1.23 per share.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From an &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071204/apfn_oracle_corp_ahead_of_the_bell.html?.v=1"&gt;AP story&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
It's hard to get too worked up about this "downgrade".  For one thing, I don't know what the difference between "Strong Buy" and "Market Outperform" might be.  Second, $23 is still a pretty good premium over the current price.  Third, the difference between $1.23 and $1.21 a share is well within noise, not much different from Wall Street's consensus, and nearly 20% up from this year.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1462622213642683514/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1462622213642683514' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1462622213642683514'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1462622213642683514'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/12/praising-with-faint-damnation.html' title='Praising with faint damnation'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7926656989375068052</id><published>2007-11-29T15:51:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-30T13:55:40.464-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><title type='text'>Sally's first year</title><content type='html'>Sally Beauty reported it's first year results since being spun off from Alberto-Culver.  I'd say the results are very encouraging.  If you &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/05/first-quarter-results.html"&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt;, the massive debt load from issuing a $25 a share dividend has been partially balanced by a significant tax savings.  For the year:
&lt;pre&gt;
Year                          2007    2006    2005    2004
Net interest expense       145,972      92   2,966   2,250
Provision for income taxes  38,121  69,916  73,154  62,059
&lt;/pre&gt;
That's a pretty significant tax savings, though not enough to offset the bigger interest expense.  Sally's ability to finance the debt out of cash flow has improved:
&lt;pre&gt;
Free cash flow             138,991 126,379  63,219 107,265
Free cash flow margin        5.53%   5.33%   2.80%   5.11%
&lt;/pre&gt;
In fact, all the margins (except net earnings) have improved:
&lt;pre&gt;
Gross margin                45.90%  45.80%  45.56%  45.33%
Operating margin             9.09%   7.59%   8.54%   8.09%
Net margin                   1.77%   4.64%   5.17%   5.02%
&lt;/pre&gt;
One of the reasons for this is that Sally has improved its inventory picture:
&lt;pre&gt;
Inventory DIO               152.82  163.15  156.17
Receivable DSO                7.46    6.99    6.53
Payable DPO                  47.41   50.12   44.94
Cash Conversion             112.87  120.03  117.76
&lt;/pre&gt;
A large part of these gains come because same store sales increased 4.5% despite losing L'Oreal products from BSG.
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, Sally Beauty is doing everything they need to do in order to make the special dividend gamble pay off.  I'm quite happy to hang onto my shares while the company pays down debt and exploits its leverage.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/7926656989375068052/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=7926656989375068052' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7926656989375068052'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7926656989375068052'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/sallys-first-year.html' title='Sally&apos;s first year'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7568642631789524091</id><published>2007-11-22T22:31:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-07T12:05:51.385-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>An options model</title><content type='html'>An option is essentially a bet on the future price of a security that can never be negative.  At the moment of expiration, the value of a call option is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  value (IV) = price (P) - strike (K) where P &gt;= K
&lt;/pre&gt;
One quirk is that an option can never be worth less then nothing.  This is the intrinsic value of the option and is an exact value because one could buy the option for IV, exercise it paying K for the shares and sell the shares at P:
&lt;pre&gt;
  IV + K = P : P &gt;= K
&lt;/pre&gt;
I don't use put options, so I won't spend too much time on them.  The intrinsic value of a put option at expiration is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  IV (put) = K - P : K &gt;= P
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If there is some time before the option expires, there is a possibility there will be some intrinsic value available at that time.  So we need to add in the time value (T) of the option:
&lt;pre&gt;
  V = P - K + T : P &gt;= K
  V = T         : P &lt; K
&lt;/pre&gt;
Obviously, the time value is zero when the option expires, so this is an expansion of the previous relationships.

(I know: I might as well try to design an airplane without wings.)  Testing it out on real prices, I've found that it give vastly different answers for most options.  But when the stock price is fairly close to the strike price and the expiration date is only a few months in the future, my estimate doesn't stray too far from the market quote.  So as a general options pricing model, this one pretty much fails.
&lt;p&gt;
But today I realized that I really don't care.  The vast majority of options are ones I don't really care to sell in the first place.  For the most part, I want to sell options with strike prices near the price I would value a company.  And options longer than a few months in duration are not interesting either since it would be hard to value the underlying shares.  Further, I don't really plan on selling options that are less than 50 or 60¢ because commissions eat up too much of the premium.  In essence, my model pins a value on the options I'd really like to sell and I don't care what it does to options I want nothing to do with.
&lt;p&gt;
Now I'm interested in selling a January $22.50 option on Oracle that currently trades for 50¢.  It's pretty far out of the money, so my model does a rotten job of evaluating its price.  It comes up with a negative price, which obviously won't work.  On the other hand, my model values the $20 option at about $1.32 while the market says the option is worth $1.50.  If I were interested in selling Oracle at $20, I'd take that price, which would amount to selling Oracle at $21.50 with a 67% probability. 
&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, if Oracle where trading at $22.50 today, I estimate that the $22.50 option would be worth about $1.24.  Now there isn't much chance that Oracle will jump from $20.21 to $22.50 in one day, but it does exist.  And if it did happen, I'd gladly sell an option on my Oracle shares for that price.  It would be a pitch I'd know what to do with.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2602149991348829458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2602149991348829458' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2602149991348829458'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2602149991348829458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/only-swing-at-soft-pitches.html' title='Only swing at soft pitches'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1969384329910258367</id><published>2007-11-19T09:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-21T11:34:26.639-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Value potential energy</title><content type='html'>Recently Vitaliy Katsenelson was &lt;a href="http://contrarianedge.com/2007/11/17/interview-with-vitaliy-katsenelson-by-philip-durell-and-bill-mann/"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; by Philip Durell and Bill Mann. I picked up a few ideas that apply to my investments.

&lt;h2&gt;Canon&lt;/h2&gt;
In the interview, Mr. Katsenelson pointed out that international investing may actually reduce risk in an otherwise US-based portfolio.  When I first bought Canon, hedging against a dollar decline factored into the decision.  Since then as the dollar has strengthened from about 105 ¥ to 109.61 ¥ with a lot of fluctuation in the interim.  Canon has been increasing their dividend which yields about 2.7% compared to the &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/japan.html"&gt;Japanese 30 year bond&lt;/a&gt; that yields 2.27%.  If (when) Japan raises rates, Canon's price measured in yen will likely go up to push its yield down.  At the same time, the yen dividend will likely be more valuable in terms of dollars.  Since Canon has a very strong product line, the stock is very close to a sure thing.
&lt;p&gt;
Another point the interview touched on is that the address of corporate headquarters doesn't tell the whole story of what countries a company is exposed to.  While Canon is largely a Japanese company, it sells products all over the world and has manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities spread around Europe, the United States, and Asia.   

&lt;h2&gt;First Marblehead&lt;/h2&gt;
I'll just quote Mr. Katsenelson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another one, and I know you guys both like is First Marblehead. This stock trades at what, eight, nine times earnings? It has a phenomenal growth rate ahead of it and I think the investors still put it into the subprime mortgage category, even thought the average FICO score of its portfolio is 714, which is very high; 83% of it loans co-signed.
&lt;p&gt;
The part that I love about it [is] this whole speculation about major customers JPMorgan and Bank of America going away [and] you can quantify that easily. You can figure out what impact it would have on the portfolio if both Bank of America and JPMorgan dropped First Marblehead and actually I figured it out and kind of my worst case, a year after JPMorgan dropped; if JPMorgan and Bank of America leave First Marblehead, its revenues would be up 20% or 30% over where they are today. So my downside is basically none.
&lt;p&gt;
You could argue that the margins may become compressed, but that the JPMorgan and Bank of America business is growing so fast that it should overcompensate that. I know you guys will agree.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Potential energy&lt;/h2&gt;

Quite a bit of the interview was actually about the importance of price when it comes to investing.  I starting thinking of it like the potential energy in a spring or a hot air balloon.  In &lt;i&gt;Active Value Investing&lt;/i&gt;, Vitaliy Katsenelson suggests the QVG framework for examining investments.  Quality (Q) could loosely be tied to earnings, Value (V) is related to price, and Growth (G) is how earnings (or cash flow) are likely to change in the future.  (This is far too simplistic I'm sure.)  To go back to the balloon analogy, price is the altitude the balloon floats at, earnings are the buoyancy of the balloon and growth is how fast that buoyancy is changing.
&lt;p&gt;
Now investors looking at the balloon from outside try to guess where it will be floating over some period of time.  As management dumps ballast (cuts costs) or adds heat (increasing revenues), the balloon ought to rise.  If it can't for some reason (investors holding the price down), the potential energy increases.  The altitude (price) is fairly easy to see, but the buoyancy and its rate of change (earnings and growth) are much harder to judge.  As a result, lower altitude (price) might actually be the best signal to buy assuming buoyancy (earnings potential) is increasing.
&lt;p&gt;
The surrounding environment contributes to the potential energy as well.  A balloon will be more buoyant on cold day, while stocks have the greatest potential in markets that have low P/E ratios.  The inverse of P/E ratios, earnings yields is a direct measure of potential energy.  Since P/E ratios for the market as a whole are trending down, prices won't be helped as much as they once were, so it's important to have good earning yields in the individual stocks you buy and own.  Canon (6.78%) and First Marblehead (13.28%) are currently have the most potential energy in my portfolio.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1969384329910258367/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1969384329910258367' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1969384329910258367'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1969384329910258367'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/value-potential-energy.html' title='Value potential energy'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2110613562590251618</id><published>2007-11-16T12:40:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-16T14:33:15.559-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQLX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQKX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Why I won't be rolling my Oracle call options</title><content type='html'>The November call option I wrote will be expiring this weekend and the December option is likely to expire too (35% chance).  But instead of rolling them forward, I now plan on hanging on to my Oracle shares for a bit longer.  I listened to the recent OpenWorld keynotes and also the analyst meeting and I think I've ignored some significant &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realoption.asp"&gt;real options&lt;/a&gt; that Oracle might exploit.
&lt;p&gt;
According to my discount cash flow models, Oracle is well within the low range of its fair value.  The market is assuming 10% growth for 10 years or 14% growth for 5 years.  Safra Catz, Oracle's CFO, has set 20% as the goal and hinted at 26% as a possibility. Normally, there would be reasons to be skeptical of these claims, but Oracle has some unique attributes that make this sort of growth possible and even likely.
&lt;p&gt;
To begin with, much of Oracle's revenues are incompressible.  In other words, once a client begins to depend on HR, accounting, CRM or other software as a critical element in their business, it isn't possible to reduce the licensing stream going to Oracle without shutting down altogether.  As a result, there is a floor on how much revenues can fall.  Also, the natural tendency is for margins to increase over time rather than decrease.  Continuing licenses are nearly cost free to Oracle because of scale.
&lt;p&gt;
Now assuming there is a recession this year and next, Oracle will have a harder time growing organically.  But the revenue stream shouldn't fall too much and it will have an opportunity to either lower costs or buy up other companies cheaply.  If the recession doesn't occur or is mild, Oracle has the option to expand its offerings organically in addition.  So because of the nature of its business, Oracle has more flexibility than most companies to deal with downturns.  That flexibility represents a real option that I hadn't accounted for in the past.  Being able to grow earnings in the face of economic headwinds could be a huge advantage.
&lt;p&gt;
I know I've flip-flopped on Oracle lately.  Part of the reason is that its share price has been jumping around my lower edge of my value estimates.  It hasn't gotten so expensive that I feel the need to sell right away, and it isn't so cheap I'm interested in buying more.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2110613562590251618/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2110613562590251618' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2110613562590251618'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2110613562590251618'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-wont-be-rolling-my-oracle-call.html' title='Why I won&apos;t be rolling my Oracle call options'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3728975022118603688</id><published>2007-11-15T13:54:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-15T17:51:31.822-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BEAS'/><title type='text'>Did BEA's financial results make it more valuable?</title><content type='html'>One of the tough things about evaluating BEA is that they have been delinquent in their SEC filings until today.  For an Oracle investor trying to see if it makes sense to acquire BEAS, the only number that really matters is total revenue.  Everything else is pretty much noise, since the purpose of such a deal would be allow much better operating margins.  Over the last 12 months, revenues were  $1,486,713,000 compared to  $1,351,967,000 the twelve months before that.  Given Oracle's operating margin (~33%), that would result in $491 million in operating income.  That is a significant increase from the $206 million it made in FY 2006, which was the most recent filings investors have had access to.  That would indicate Oracle would need to raise its price.
&lt;p&gt;
But I don't think that is going to happen.  For one, only $541 million of the revenues are from licenses&amp;mdash;the rest are from far less profitable services.  Also, BEA's operating income was actually negative over the last 12 months.  So independent of Oracle or some other buyer, BEAS may be worth less than it was before.  Further, the profitable license reviews are decreasing while Oracle's middleware sales are increasing.  In any case, Oracle is in an excellent negotiating position.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3728975022118603688/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3728975022118603688' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3728975022118603688'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3728975022118603688'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/did-beas-financial-results-make-it-more.html' title='Did BEA&apos;s financial results make it more valuable?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5366100453991655126</id><published>2007-11-07T12:57:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-07T13:09:11.032-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Can First Marblehead be worth $10?</title><content type='html'>Seeking Alpha asks: &lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/52700-first-marblehead-worth-10-or-60"&gt;First Marblehead: Worth $10 or $60?&lt;/a&gt;  Without going into the arguments presented, which weren't particularly quantitative anyway, I don't see how you could value the stock at $10.  $60 or $30 or nothing seem better guesses.
&lt;p&gt;
Let's take the case for the business being worthless.  Basically, if management is somehow fraudulent and has stolen or wasted all of the cash in the coffers while rendering the residuals on the balance sheet valueless.  Throw in a lawsuit or ten for good measure.  In that case, the company is headed for bankruptcy court.  Otherwise, cash and residuals are worth about $10.80 a share all by themselves.  Perhaps the residuals are carried on the books at a higher price than if they were sold on the market, but First Marblehead doesn't need to sell them at market prices as long as it's still in business.  And as long as the company is still in business, its value is higher than the $10.80 per share book value.
&lt;p&gt;
A dividend discount model prices the current $1.10 a year dividend at $33 1/2 even if the dividend never increased.  To state it another way, income of $1.10 a year forever discounted to the present at 11% is worth more than $30.  Forever sounds like a long time, but it's important to remember the discount model explicitly weighs income from distant years less than income in the near future.  Because the dividend in 2100 is much less likely than the dividend in 2010 it also provides a much smaller portion of the present value of the dividend stream.
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, so if First Marblehead isn't a complete disaster or a static income stream, what other possibilities exist?  Well, it could continue to grow at a healthy, though maybe not rocket-like, pace.  Presumably, the dividend cannot continue to grow at 77% like it did last year nor can earnings increase by 57%, 48%, or 112% as they did in the last three years.  So let's assume the dividend grows by 10% or earnings grow by 15% over the next five years.  In those scenarios, I calculate First Marblehead shares are worth about $60 each.  Given some growth in First Marblehead's business, I don't think many would consider these growth rates aggressive.
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, you could put together an expected value based on the odds of the $0, $30, and $60 scenarios panning out, but I don't think I'll bother.  The $0 and $30 values are based on completely unlikely possibilities in my opinion.  They might be 5% possibilities combined.  I'd say my $60 scenario has a better than 5% chance of being far too conservative, but we don't need to consider that to see that at $33 1/2  FMD is a bargain.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5366100453991655126/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5366100453991655126' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5366100453991655126'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5366100453991655126'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/can-first-marblehead-be-worth-10.html' title='Can First Marblehead be worth $10?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2847653232097440078</id><published>2007-11-06T10:54:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-06T17:16:19.963-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQLX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQKX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BEAS'/><title type='text'>Why I sold two more call options on Oracle</title><content type='html'>This morning I sold November and December $22.50 call options that cover all of my remaining shares of Oracle for 60¢ and $1.05 respectively.  I've already discussed a number of reasons for trying to sell, so I won't go into too much detail.  I should note, that a) my call options have captured nearly a full year of Oracle's earnings and b) I find Wall Street's estimate of &lt;a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2007/11/06/microsoft-bumped-from-goldman-americas-conviction-list-replaced-by-oracle-what-it-means-for-bea/?mod=yahoobarrons"&gt;20% earnings growth&lt;/a&gt; seems fairly unlikely.  In fact, the next few quarters may very well be disappointing because of a global slowdown.  Buying BEA, even at a discount, just isn't enough to justify Oracle's current market price and make up the difference.
&lt;p&gt;
I should point out that by writing calls for two separate expiry dates I'm raising my costs fairly dramatically.  Assuming both options are assigned, I basically have doubled my costs.  But I've also doubled my opportunities.  Imagine a coin-flipping offer where you earn a prize each time you flip heads and lose the coin the first time you flip tails.  If you can chose between one coin that earns $2 for heads or two coins that earn a dollar each, which is a better choice?  Although the expected return on the first turn is the same ($1), taking two coins gives you a 3 of 4 chance to go to a second turn as opposed to a 50% with one coin.  This won't change the expected return, but it does keep you in the game longer.  With two coins, you have more expected options to leave the game if the odds were to shift.
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to a 3.4% increase in Oracle today, the odds the November option will be used are 63% and for the December option 66%.  There isn't much short interest to propel shares higher on unexpected news and the market is already expecting good news during next week's OpenWorld conference and Q2 earnings announced in December.  Therefor, I feel these options are likely to be profitable for me even if my shares are called away.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2847653232097440078/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2847653232097440078' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2847653232097440078'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2847653232097440078'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-sold-two-more-call-options-on.html' title='Why I sold two more call options on Oracle'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2443329711694714720</id><published>2007-10-30T17:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-02T15:38:44.822-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Earnings yield of my IRA</title><content type='html'>Currently, my IRA is flat on the year compared to an 8% or so gain for the S&amp;P 500 and a 17% gain for Berkshire.  Select Comfort (-37.5%) and First Marblehead (-28.25%) are the primary culprits, though Canon is somehow down 11% on the year too.  Now I don't like the idea of seeing my portfolio stagnate, but there is a ray of hope here: my IRA's earnings yield is improving.
&lt;p&gt;
Here's how I calculate yield for my portfolio.  Each quarter, I multiply the EPS for each company I own by the number of shares I hold at the end of the quarter.  I add up those numbers and at the end of the year I have a value for "look-through" earnings.  That's how much my stocks would have returned if they had paid out 100% of earnings in the form of a cash dividend.  For 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quarter earnings, I use analyst or company estimates which are decent first-order guesses.  Then I divide by the total value of my portfolio to get look-through yield.
&lt;pre&gt;
Yield         2007   2006   2005   2004   2003   2002
-----        ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Look-through  4.57%  3.90%  5.22%  3.65%  3.20%  2.59%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since my account value has not changed significantly since the beginning of the year, the increase in yield is entirely due to increases in my companies' earnings.  This measure does not include income from cash in the numerator, but it does include cash in the denominator.  That means, cash-heavy portfolios are penalized.  One solution would be to subtract cash from the denominator.  A better solution is to add in interest earned to the numerator.  I also add in premiums from call options, profits from short-term arbitrages, and cash dividends, while subtracting commissions, fees, and option losses.  This produces a sort of operating earnings yield:
&lt;pre&gt;
Yield         2007   2006   2005   2004   2003   2002
-----        ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Look-through  4.57%  3.90%  5.22%  3.65%  3.20%  2.59%
Operating     6.21%  5.76%  5.46%  3.70%  1.97%  1.74%
&lt;/pre&gt;
I know this double counts cash dividends, which are also reflected in look through earnings.  Notice that my cash position has added to earnings in the last two years thanks to a number of arbitrage opportunities.
&lt;p&gt;
Higher yields indicate a sort of potential energy for a portfolio.  Like the spring in a windup toy, increasing earnings give a portfolio a chance to run.  Over a long period of time and given more or less efficient markets, an increase in earnings would represent a corresponding increase in price.  Imagine what would happen to a company that earned 50¢ a share and sold for $10 were to increase earnings to $1 a share.  If the yield remained at 5%, the stock would also double to $20.  But until those gains are realized by selling the stock, that $10 a share increase will not be released.  In order to calculate the effects of buying low and selling high, I add in realized gains and special dividends (like the one Sally Beauty distributed last year).
&lt;pre&gt;
Yield         2007   2006   2005   2004   2003   2002
-----        ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Look-through  4.57%  3.90%  5.22%  3.65%  3.20%  2.59%
Operating     6.21%  5.76%  5.46%  3.70%  1.97%  1.74%
Net          12.84% 18.31%  5.46%  3.70% 12.92%  1.74%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, the net yield is extremely choppy.  The simplest solution is to take the geometric mean, which is the best way to get an average of rates or percentages:
&lt;pre&gt;
Yield         2007   2006   2005   2004   2003   2002
-----        ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Look-through  4.57%  3.90%  5.22%  3.65%  3.20%  2.59%
Operating     6.21%  5.76%  5.46%  3.70%  1.97%  1.74%
Net          12.84% 18.31%  5.46%  3.70% 12.92%  1.74%
Geomean       6.89%  6.08%  4.62%  4.36%  4.74%  1.74%
&lt;/pre&gt;
This smooths the data to show that net yields are also creeping up for my portfolio.
&lt;p&gt;
So what does all this mean?  In my opinion, these yields are a rough estimate of potential.  As I make good investments in companies that are cheap and have high earnings, my portfolio potential goes up.  When I'm able to make money with the cash potion of the account, as I have over the last few years, I increase my portfolio's potential a bit more.  When I harvest some of that potential by selling positions or receiving special distributions from a position, I have a chance to reinvest in companies with increased earnings potential.  As I make good choices in allocating assets, my portfolio's yield and potential increase.
&lt;p&gt;
It's important to look at measures besides stock value when considering changes in investments.  At the moment, First Marblehead and Select Comfort have the highest earnings yield, but are my worst performers.  Oracle has the lowest yield, but is also one of the bright spots in terms of price performance.  A narrow focus on recent price movement (momentum investing) would lead me to cut my losers and ride my winners.  But as a contrarian investor, I'm looking to sell Oracle (low potential) and buy First Marblehead (high potential).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2443329711694714720/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2443329711694714720' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2443329711694714720'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2443329711694714720'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/earnings-yield-of-my-ira.html' title='Earnings yield of my IRA'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2422041767365931877</id><published>2007-10-30T09:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-13T14:35:15.653-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TPX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Is Select Comfort a "scary stock"?</title><content type='html'>This is a response to &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/10/29/worlds-scariest-stock-select-comfort.aspx"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; on the Motley Fool.  I'd post it as a comment, but the site ate my post.  (I think it filtered out everything after the '&amp;' in "R&amp;D", which is a pretty bogus behavior.)
&lt;p&gt;
First, operating profits are down because of increased marketing and R&amp;D--other expense lines are down.  Second, buybacks are good investments if the market is undervaluing shares, not because they raise EPS in the short-term.  Third, the changes in capital structure  are nearly riskless because of Select Comfort's massive and growing cash flows.
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately, a lower stock price combined with a commitment to marketing, R&amp;D, and share buybacks are very positive signs if you believe the company has a superior product.  If the company's product turns out to be a fad or is overtaken by competitor copies or improvements, these moves hasten its eventual demise.  The reason is that these changes are increasing the company's leverage.  Small improvements will be magnified into big improvements and small declines will be magnified into big declines.
&lt;p&gt;
So the comparison with Tempur-Pedic is actually encouraging to Select Comfort investors.   The Sleep Number bed shares more similarities to foam mattresses than traditional mattresses sold by other companies.  In fact, some Sleep Number beds use similar foam to form the top layer over the air chambers.  As far as price, Select Comfort offers additional features, such as firmness control, at nearly identical prices to Tempur-Pedic.  (For instance, a 4000 Queen is $1,199.99 at Select Comfort and The Original Queen is $1,199 at Tempur-Pedic.)  If compared to traditional beds, it's possible to buy a queen size for around $600, which is right in the sweet spot for quality mattresses.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2422041767365931877/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2422041767365931877' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2422041767365931877'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2422041767365931877'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/is-select-comfort-scary-stock.html' title='Is Select Comfort a &quot;scary stock&quot;?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4393619718717367367</id><published>2007-10-25T10:06:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-25T16:46:54.779-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BEAS'/><title type='text'>Dickering over the price</title><content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;

Well, BEA has responded to Oracle's Sunday deadline to take or leave a $17 a share buyout with a $21 a share counter offer.  When the offer was originally announced, I estimated that $18.55 a share was a fair price, but considered the possibility of a $21 offer.  The market is pricing BEAS at $17.67, which is a touch low in my opinion.  The two companies have been rumored to be in merger talks for years, but only this month have the rumors been confirmed.  
&lt;p&gt;
Here's my guess about what has happened since then:  Initially, BEA rejected the Oracle offer because it hoped some other company would step in with a competing bid.  When that didn't happen, management sent Oracle a letter rejecting the bid again saying it was too low.  Oracle responded by setting a limit on the offer of this Sunday.  Now BEA was in a bind: if it let the offer expire, it would be clear that there was no competing offer.  But management needed to induce Oracle to bid more.  That is why they produced the counter offer.
&lt;p&gt;
We know that Oracle will end up buying BEA.  The only remaining question is the price.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4393619718717367367/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4393619718717367367' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4393619718717367367'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4393619718717367367'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/dickering-over-price.html' title='Dickering over the price'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-338907587198511985</id><published>2007-10-18T15:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-19T16:07:45.734-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Buffet, Berkshire and Bayes</title><content type='html'>Since mid-August, Berkshire Hathaway stock has jumped 15% or so from where it has been sitting most of the year.  The jump in October, has been about 8%.  I found this puzzling for a while, since there hasn't been any real news from Berkshire except some transactions in railroad and oil stocks.  But then I started to think about a paragraph in the 2006 annual report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order. Our most important business, insurance, benefited from a large dose of luck: Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation. After hammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 – storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat insurance – she just vanished. Last year, the red ink from this activity turned black – very black.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
2007 has been every bit as quiet for the U.S. Gulf region and the current hurricane season is very nearly over.  I don't know for a fact, but it wouldn't surprise me if most of the price movement over the last two months have been based on lowered expectations of super-cat insurance payouts.
&lt;p&gt;
Now there is no doubt that the lack of hurricanes this year will have a very similar effect on Berkshire's 2007 earnings as in 2006.  And that is certainly good news to investors.  So it isn't really a surprise that investors link a relatively mild hurricane season to increased stock price.

Logically, monopolies are detrimental in every industry because a single supplier is able to control prices that customers must pay.  But there are some cases where a monopolistic structure seems to be not so bad or at least a natural result in certain industries.
&lt;p&gt;
In software, there are only two real factors in a purchasing decision: price and features.  Price isn't just the amount that goes into the software company's pocket, but also the cost to implement and maintain a system.  For large systems, the cost to simply train users might dwarf all other costs combined.  As Microsoft has taught us, the biggest company tends to win out when price is the primary factor if only because training costs can be minimized.  Nobody bothers to mention "Microsoft Windows" or "Microsoft Office" on a resume anymore, because every halfway qualified candidate has learned to use those programs already.
&lt;p&gt;
The other factor is features.  Since the biggest companies have a huge advantage on the price side of the equation, upstart companies must compete on features.  In my experience, it's fairly difficult to justify spending more on software on the basis of "nice-to-have" features.  So in order to compete with bigger competitors, a small software company needs to create functionality that is so totally different and useful that its customers start to depend on it.  For instance, a few years ago I purchased a copy of Quicken that downloads all of my transactions from my bank's website.  Since I've grown to depend on this feature, Intuit has locked me into their software indefinitely.
&lt;p&gt;
The other lesson Microsoft has taught us is that big companies have an advantage when it comes to features as well, if the big companies catch the trend soon enough to copy the feature.  For instance, Excel, Word, Windows, Money, Internet Explorer, and Outlook were introduced in order to outflank Lotus 123, WordPerfect, Macintosh, Quicken, and Netscape.  There are dozens of smaller examples as well.  Apple and Intuit survived only because they stayed under the radar long enough to lock-in a critical mass of customers before Microsoft moved in.  Other competitors, such as Google, have thrived because Microsoft didn't understand their features until it was too late to emulate.  Notice that these mistakes and oversights have occurred more often as Microsoft and the software industry have grown.  It's just too hard for them to see everything that is going on.
&lt;p&gt;
From the customer's viewpoint, the Microsoft monopoly has been surprisingly benign.  Sure, personal computers are probably too expensive because of the Windows and Office taxes, but cooperate America's software training costs are probably lower than they would be with more variety.  It's hard to say if we are suffering from a lack of features, but until recently Microsoft has been the leader in distributing new types of software.  Where they have failed, it seems like some other company has filled in the gap fairly quickly.  In either case, innovation has thrived under the Microsoft monopoly to a greater extent than is possible to imagine under the IBM monopoly of the the 1970's.
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, once a monopoly develops, there is a new reason to buy software from a particular company: there is no other choice.  And if everyone knows the monopolistic company will simply copy any new and revolutionary product, there is little reason for startups to startup.  On the other hand, if the biggest companies are willing to buy up smaller players, like Microsoft in the 1990's and Oracle in the last three years, there is an incentive to fill functional gaps.  From the market leader's perspective, purchasing successful competitors when they are small is both cheaper and more certain than developing their own copy.  Customers also benefit, since the original products tend to be better than the imitations, at least for a while.
&lt;p&gt;
So the dynamics of the software industry may produce benevolent monopolies if:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big companies drive down the total cost of software ownership.
&lt;li&gt;Small companies have an incentive to compete on features and are not overly afraid of their ideas being copied by larger companies.
&lt;/ol&gt;
It's like a pond with two niches: small fish (that specialize in features) and big fish (that reduce overall price).  Companies like BEA are in the uncomfortable middle: too big to be truly innovative and too small to be cost effective for customers.  In this case, if the big fish swallows the medium-sized one, it might be best for the entire ecosystem.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1171471556475942752/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1171471556475942752' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1171471556475942752'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1171471556475942752'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/could-monopolies-be-healthly-for.html' title='Could monopolies be healthly for the software industry?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3900906934098645926</id><published>2007-10-12T14:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-16T15:46:46.776-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQJX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BEAS'/><title type='text'>Oracle's offer to BEA</title><content type='html'>It looks like I won't sell Oracle for $22.50 this week (1 chance in 5).  I plan to continue trying to write $22.50 call options on my shares because they continue to be fully-valued.  I mentioned last month, that it is nice to have &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/having-multiple-reasons-to-own.html"&gt;more than one reason&lt;/a&gt; to own a stock and the income from writing options is a good reason.  Besides that, if the option is exercised, I feel I'm getting a fair price.
&lt;p&gt;
The big news for Oracle was their offer last week to buy BEA.  I've learned a bit about how to evaluate mergers and I think the offer is pretty good, but is likely too be raised before all is said and done.  If the premium offered is less than the expected value of the synergies produced, a transaction my be considered successful.  In this case, the premium is at least $1.3 billion.  Before the announcement, BEAS was priced at $13.62 a share and the offer price is $17&amp;mdash;a premium of $3.38 a share times 392 million shares.  Oracle &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2007_oct/bea-ltr-response.html"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; it considers the premium to be even higher: "Our proposed price is a substantial premium to an already-inflated stock price that reflected speculation of the potential sale of BEA and represents a more than 40% premium to BEA's stock price before the appearance of activist shareholders in mid-August of this year."  &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aIpQbuM3RQHM&amp;refer=home"&gt;Carl Icahn&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, the "activist shareholders" the letter refers to.  I'm not going to factor that in, however, since the stock traded higher than $14 as recently as July 19 of this year and has been in the general range for most of the last twelve months.
&lt;p&gt;
Synergies are a bit harder to calculate.  The market clearly thinks Oracle will need to raise its price since BEAS is trading at $18.55 a share (a $1.9 billion premium).  An obvious source of synergy stems from Oracle's high operating margin (33%) compared to BEA's (14%).  If Oracle simply trimmed BEA costs to match its own, it would earn an extra $205 million a year in synergies.  Using an 11% cost of capital, that works out to about $1.9 billion.  Further benefits, such as the ability to cross-sell products to BEA customers and technological improvements, are not included but are also less certain and harder to calculate.  I'd assume they are a counter-balanced by integration costs, but they probably do exist.
&lt;p&gt;
I just read the chapter on &lt;a href="http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/chapter10.shtml"&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5pL93tid0TkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=svar+shareholder+value+at+risk&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9Ek9MUI9lE&amp;sig=Wcw1w89SKRCQTdafn30ebSFSD78#PPA153,M1"&gt;Expectations Investing&lt;/a&gt;.  One important concept it presents is Shareholder Value at Risk (SVAR), which quantifies how much of current shareholder's value the company is betting on an acquisition.  For an all-cash offer, the math is pretty easy and works out to 1.2%.  If the offer goes up to $18.55, as the market currently predicts, the SVAR is 1.7%.  The highest offer I've seen speculated is $21 a share, which would risk 2.5% of shareholders current value.  Any way you slice it, this offer will not have a huge impact on Oracle's long-term performance.
&lt;p&gt;
So to sum up, I like Oracle's prospects and the current offer to BEA, but I'm still trying to sell call options so that I can earn some extra income on this fairly-valued position.

It is a small Kentucky insurance company that announced a 1-for-250 reverse split with fractional shares cashed out at $7.25 a share.  I've been burned in two straight going-private transactions, but I think this one will work out.  Here are my reasons:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a reverse split with no corresponding forward split.  That was how the BNS Holding transaction burned me because it only temporarily produced fractional shares.  Since there is no forward split and no fractional shares will be issued, my broker will need to cash my shares out whether I'm a shareholder of record or not.
&lt;li&gt;Over 60% of shares are owned by insiders, so the vote will go their way.  Most likely, they will not back out of the transaction because the company will clearly benefit from savings from eliminating public-company costs.
&lt;li&gt;Book value per share is about $7.90, which means even the $7.25 offer is a discount to the company's value.  In fact, since many shares will be retired, the book value per share will actually increase.  For an insurance company, book value is a better guess at intrinsic value than any measure based on earnings.  That's because the rules for recognizing earning don't work well for the insurance business.
&lt;li&gt;Given a 95% chance of success and the pre-announce price of $6.42 as a base, the Kelly Criterion suggests I'd be safe putting 92%+ of my portfolio into Citizens Financial.  Even if the company is worth nothing, the percentage would be nearly 40%.  The market currently prices the odds at 15.66%, which is far too low in my opinion.
&lt;/ul&gt;

I need to remind myself that though the results have been less than I expected recently, my process has been sound.  It's easy to claim that failures are due to bad luck, but in this case I believe it to be true.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6865323154283750077/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6865323154283750077' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6865323154283750077'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6865323154283750077'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/why-i-bought-citizens-financial.html' title='Why I bought Citizens Financial Corporation'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2381417518875681603</id><published>2007-10-10T14:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-10T17:24:47.798-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQKX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SAP'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQJX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BOBJ'/><title type='text'>Why I'm selling Oracle</title><content type='html'>I'm now in the process of writing in-the-money call options on my remaining Oracle shares with the intention of closing my position soon.  Today I sold a $22.50 October call for 60¢ when Oracle was selling for about $22.85.  By my calculations, there is about a 63% chance the option would be exercised.  Oracle ended the day at $22.92, which boosts the odds a couple of percentage points.  After commission, I'll be selling  Oracle for the equivalent of $23 a share in about 9 days.  I'm also trying to sell November options to cover the rest of my Oracle position.
&lt;p&gt;
In my opinion, Oracle is no longer a good value.  A conservative growth assumption of 10% a year for the next 5 years would come out to about &lt;a href="http://www.quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=intrinsic&amp;cursym=&amp;csym=ORCL&amp;csym1=&amp;csym2=&amp;initearnec=4%2C443%2C999%2C744&amp;egrrbtn=dd&amp;egrdd=1&amp;egrec=&amp;dcrrbtn=dd&amp;dcrec=15.00&amp;dcrdd=2&amp;passtick=1&amp;p=ORCL"&gt;$21 a share&lt;/a&gt;.  Using more aggressive growth rates will produce higher estimates, of course, but we are now firmly in the range of reasonable valuations.  That makes Oracle less attractive to hold and unattractive to buy.  If there was a dividend, especially if there was a good chance it would be raised, I'd have more reason to hang on.  But the share buybacks Oracle currently uses to return value to shareholders don't excite me at these prices.
&lt;p&gt;
I should note that Oracle will continue to be on my radar over the next few years because it is a business that is not well understood.  Earlier this week, SAP made an offer to buy Business Objects, which was widely reported as a change in course to Oracle's acquisition strategy.  The trouble with that statement is that Oracle's strategy isn't to just buy up competitors, but to get the best software even if it has to buy whole companies to do so.  SAP might be doing the right thing, but only if  Business Objects to improves SAP's own suite of products and doesn't cost too much.  SAP's action doesn't "validate Oracle's strategy"&amp;mdash;it merely increases the cost for Oracle to buy good businesses.  So it's been odd to see Oracle's price going up this week rather than down.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2381417518875681603/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2381417518875681603' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2381417518875681603'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2381417518875681603'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/why-im-selling-oracle.html' title='Why I&apos;m selling Oracle'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2284925182661377165</id><published>2007-10-08T10:28:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-08T12:22:16.524-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Taking a stab at valuing options</title><content type='html'>Since I started selling options a year ago, I've been fairly unsatisfied with the standard models of valuing them.

It seems to be the usual reason the market undervalues companies.  In this case, Select Comfort has swung from a hot, growth stock to a company with troubles on several fronts.  They had to take a big one-time expense because of an abandoned computer system.  New fire-retardant regulations reduced company earnings to an extent.  But the big news is the housing slump that slowed mattress sales.  Also, Select Comfort's new ad campaign failed to bring in costumers.  As a result, EPS for the last quarter was down 69.41% YoY and for the last 12-months EPS is down 19.48%.  Sales last quarter were down 4.84% and for the last 12-months, sales are only up 5.06%&amp;mdash;a far cry from management's 15% goal.
&lt;p&gt;
But the further back you go, the harder it is to see a problem.  Over the last 5 years, sales have grown 25.23% and EPS has gone from -66¢ in 2001 to 85¢ last year.  Gross and operating margins have improved dramatically.  Management has predicted more margin improvements this year too.  The company has a negative cash conversion cycle and new stores pay for themselves within a few months.  The &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/four-factors-of-value-creation.html"&gt;Four Factors&lt;/a&gt; are moving in the right direction, so earnings yield is higher than a year ago.  So the question comes down to has Select Comfort's business changed so that the next five years will be much slower than the last five.
&lt;p&gt;
To be certain, growth in the last five years came on the back of fixing a broken sales and marketing system, expanding into new markets and controlling costs.  Those low-hanging fruit are long gone.  But the market is pricing in about 8.4% growth, which is nowhere close to the 14% projected by the most pessimistic analyst.  I think the disconnect is that the market is looking out only one or two years.  Because of the current macro-economy, the next two quarters look like they will be flat earnings-wise.  But over the next five to ten years, Select Comfort has tremendous operational advantages.
&lt;p&gt;
Consider they way mattresses are traditionally bought and sold.  Since people rarely buy more than once every decade or so, they don't have any reason to spend a lot of time thinking about how to do it.  Unlike buying a car, mattress shopping seems boring and unimportant.  Consumers look for things like brand, an in-home trial, manufacturer's warranty, and price.  These are shortcuts that people use so that they can get a mattress they are comfortable with and get on with their lives.  It's relatively easy to manipulate people using these shortcuts.  For instance, there's a mattress store here in Southern California that advertises very heavily with the slogan, "We’ll beat any advertised price, or your mattress is FREEEE!"  At first glance, one would assume the store is losing money (which is the way the commercials spin it) or is working on razor thin margins to avoid giving away the store.  But the fact is each chain carries slightly different models with &lt;a href="http://www.leedsmattress.com/customer_main.html"&gt;different names&lt;/a&gt; so that each store can claim to offer the lowest price.  The low price message must be drilled into the consumer's consciousness because you never know when they might in the market for a mattress.
&lt;p&gt;
Since Select Comfort offers a unique style of mattress and controls the retail experience for the most part, it can differentiate itself without resorting to product name shenanigans.  The key will be a long-term, consistent focus on the unique attributes of the product.  Just having a storefront in the mall that people walk past year after year improves the odds that they will buy a Sleep Number bed.  When combined with advertising (especially on the radio), it should be possible to encourage most people in a market to at least consider it.  Management hasn't moved into non-US markets so far because they see plenty of potential in US markets they haven't tapped so far.
&lt;p&gt;
Sealy cut prices in the face of slow sales, but ended with &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/10/05/sleep-apnea-at-sealy.aspx"&gt;a bad quarter&lt;/a&gt; in terms of earnings.  Tempur-Pedic, on the other hand, &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/07/20/tempur-pedic-is-just-right.aspx"&gt;recently raised prices&lt;/a&gt; yet sales increased.  The purchase cycle is very long for mattresses, so its hard to read too much into a few quarters, but it seems foam has become a legitimate substitute for traditional innerspring models.  Select Comfort might benefit since newer models come with improved foam toppers.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3665599883679411395/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3665599883679411395' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3665599883679411395'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3665599883679411395'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/10/case-for-select-comfort.html' title='The case for Select Comfort'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8469351246880400491</id><published>2007-10-02T13:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-22T22:49:46.625-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Bubble pricing</title><content type='html'>Consider two stocks:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trades in a range from $5 to $15.
&lt;li&gt;Trades in a range from $9 to $11.
&lt;/ol&gt;
The not too difficult question is: which stock is riskier?  And given no more information, A is the riskier stock.  That's because the greater volatility means you could lose more money with A than trading in B&amp;mdash;at least if you only had price information to work with.
&lt;p&gt;
But if you knew for certain that the actual value of each stock was $10, than A ought to be far &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; risky.  Instead of trading randomly, an investor could begin buying once stock A is priced below its value and sell when the stock is above its value for a true arbitrage situation.  This is Ben Graham's margin of safety principle.  One little piece of information (the value of the stock) makes a huge difference.  
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, we can never really be certain about anything, much less the value of a company that might have skeletons lurking in its metaphorical closet.  The fact is, markets are often right.  That's because of somewhat bizarre phenomenon known as the &lt;a href="http://www.leggmasoncapmgmt.com/pdf/Explaining_the_Wisdom_of_Crowds.pdf"&gt;wisdom of crowds&lt;/a&gt;.  In essence, the crowd is more likely than the individual to the answer to certain questions correctly if at least three conditions are true:
&lt;ol type="I"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There exists a diversity of thought.
&lt;li&gt;There exists an aggregating mechanism.
&lt;li&gt;There exists an incentive to individuals for being right.
&lt;/ol&gt;
If any one of them is missing, an individual has a chance to do better than the crowd.  But a well-designed market has all three of these conditions most of the time.  Therefore, if we want to invest in stock A, we ought to make a case not only why $10 is the right price, but also why crowd wisdom doesn't apply.
&lt;p&gt;
A familiar case is the asset bubble.  For instance, a group of investors might decide that stock A is worth $15, not $10.  So they start to buy whatever shares they can lay hands on.  Then some people decide the stock might be worth more like $20 and bid up the price further.  The jump from $5 to $20 attracts speculators who don't know, and may not care, how much A is worth.  At this point anyone who owned A and thought it was worth $10 or even $15 has taken a profit and anyone foolish enough to be short has either covered or lost their shirt.  So both sides of each trade are people who believe in the company at any price.  Condition I is thoroughly violated.
&lt;p&gt;
But there is also a problem with conditions II and III as well.  Bearish opinions on the stock are not aggregated because there is no incentive to take a position.  It is difficult to make money on negative opinions in the current stock market because short trading is both difficult and dangerous.  The same can be said about the housing market, except substitute impossible for difficult and dangerous.  Early on, when it might help with little pain, the crowd can't apply the brakes.
&lt;p&gt;
I've been playing the &lt;a href="http://caps.fool.com/Index.aspx"&gt;Motley Fool CAPS&lt;/a&gt; game and, even though I'm doing a terrible job there, I think its a pretty useful tool.  Instead of judging success on an absolute basis, picks are compared to an investment in the S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.  So, a thumbs up pick might be losing even if the stock price has gone up if the index has gone up faster.  If you read a mutual fund prospectus, the concept ought to be clear.  More importantly, thumbs down picks win as long as the index does better than the stock.
&lt;p&gt;
You accomplish the same effect by selling as stock short and using the proceeds to buy an ETF that tracks the index.  It would be somewhat expensive, however, since you would need to pay twice the number of commissions and there is normally a margin requirement.  Perhaps some sort of ETF or derivative could be devised to solve the problem.  It's also possible to simulate a relative return on a bullish position, but this wouldn't normally make sense unless you thought the index was due for a fall.

First Marblehead doesn't bother me too much because I just bought shares and I can't believe how cheap they are.  The first and primary reason to own a company for a value investor is that shares are worth far more than the price assigned them by the market.  It's sort of the litmus test of value investing.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort is a different story.  Since I doubled-down, at the end of 2006, the price has gone down, but so has the value.  Based on 85¢ EPS last year and 20% projected growth, a fair value would have been about $34 a share.  But this year, 87¢ EPS seems pretty optimistic and 15% is a better guess for growth, which makes my best guess for Select Comfort's value to be $24 1/2.  I wouldn't argue against a valuation as low as $20 or so.  Even so, this is still less than the $18 I paid last year or the $13.30 (adjusted for a 3:2 split) I paid in 2005.
&lt;p&gt;
The other reason First Marblehead is easier to own is that it pays a regular dividend.  I cheer for low prices since they mean I'm reinvesting at low prices.  But Select Comfort doesn't pay a dividend.  They do have a buyback program, which I expect is taking full advantage of the low prices the market is offering.  I still prefer a dividend, however, since it is more certain and reliable.  First Marblehead is buying back shares as well, so I'm doubly pleased.
&lt;p&gt;
One lesson I've learned from Select Comfort over the last year is that as a stock price approaches parity with its value, there needs to be another reason to own the stock.  You can't force a company to pay a dividend and share buybacks become less worthwhile, so selling becomes a reasonable option even for a company that is operating on all cylinders.  As I have done with Select Comfort and Oracle, you don't have to place a sell order in order to sell a stock&amp;mdash;writing a call option works nearly as well.  I missed that chance a year ago when Select Comfort was trading near $25, but I won't miss it next time.
&lt;p&gt;
I've already started practicing sell discipline with Oracle.  Improving, rather than worsening, financial conditions make a company easier to own.  But stock prices tend to peak around the time that performance peaks.  If price are getting close to value,  there has to be another reason to keep the company.  At the moment, Oracle is priced to grow earnings at 14.5%.  Though this is possible, I'm afraid there is a real possibility Oracle's business could falter like Select Comfort's did.  I don't see any reason to take that risk when there are other investments that trade well under their current value.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8558797649833301650/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8558797649833301650' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8558797649833301650'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8558797649833301650'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/having-multiple-reasons-to-own.html' title='Having multiple reasons to own'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-379701415676359477</id><published>2007-09-24T12:58:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-09-26T09:51:20.697-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Why I bought more shares in First Marblehead</title><content type='html'>This is as close to a no-brainer as I've seen.  Six months ago, I thought First Marblehead was cheap and now its business has improved and its price has dropped.  Recently, the company raised the dividend 10% (which is on top of a 67% increase in June).  Even if the dividend never goes up again, the dividend discount model suggests a value of $33 1/2 or so.  A modest 10% increase for the next 5 years followed by no further increases is worth about $57 1/2 according to my model.  According to the Quicken DCF model, Marblehead only needs to grow at 1.8% to justify its current price.
&lt;p&gt;
The only thing that has been missing for the last few months has been cash to augment my position.  Thankfully, I was able to lighten up on Oracle just in time to collect a larger dividend on my shares this morning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Update September 24:&lt;/h2&gt;
I found &lt;a href="http://blogvesting.com/2007/fmd-multiple-uncertainties-hide-underpriced-stock/"&gt;another opinion&lt;/a&gt; of First Marblehead that echoes my feelings and assigns a range of values to the company.  Even under the worst case when everything falls apart for the company, the author assigns a price per share of $42.  I've found that my best investments occurred when I couldn't figure out how a company could be valued as low as the market price.  For instance, when I first bought Oracle, it seemed like the market was operating under the assumption that the database business was dead.  Both times I bought Canon, the market seemed to have factored in only minimal growth.  If I had bought Select Comfort when I first looked into it and it was trading in single digits, that would have been the same story.  In fact, the market scared me out of buying the mattress company until the price was more in line with its value.
&lt;p&gt;
In First Marblehead, I think the market is crazy and it thinks the same of me.  One of us is right and the other will be shown wrong in the next few years.  This is an ideal example of why value investing is normally contrarian investing as well.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/379701415676359477/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=379701415676359477' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/379701415676359477'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/379701415676359477'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/why-i-bought-more-shares-in-first.html' title='Why I bought more shares in First Marblehead'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3982378423269634282</id><published>2007-09-21T13:27:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-09-22T16:17:41.103-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQID'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Why I sold Oracle and how I wiped out my option profit</title><content type='html'>So the Oracle September call option &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/search/label/ORQID"&gt;I sold&lt;/a&gt; is going to be exercised this weekend since Oracle finished the day at $21.98 a share.  Using &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/my-stock-option-insurance-business.html"&gt;the rules&lt;/a&gt; I established for accounting option gains and losses, selling the option cost me $1.98 a share.  Since I only received 55¢ a share of premium and also paid a commission, I took a pretty ugly accounting loss on the transaction.  In fact, this single loss would nearly wipe out all the premiums I've earned since I began selling call options this year.  When adding in costs, my combined ratio is an abysmal 121.92%.  
&lt;p&gt;
Without this single transaction, my combined ratio was an amazing 24.74%.  I don't really have a large enough sample to measure myself yet, but this tells me that I'm settling for too little premium when I write call options.  In fact, I was pretty surprised to see that Oracle's price had jumped from $19.36 to $20.13 on the day I sold the option.  Rather than a 35% chance of losing, I sold a option that was nearly a coin-flip.  If options were my full time job, I would have noticed the price change and adjusted my limit order to capture more premium.  Options are so much more volatile than the underlying stock that the full-time trader has a distinct advantage.
&lt;p&gt;
But even if I had written the call for a reasonable price, I would certainly have lost this particular bet.  Oracle's stellar earnings release, that came on Thursday, assured that the option would be exercised at a loss.  The market's response to lower rates didn't help either.  Now, I don't really mind too much because I still have plenty of Oracle shares that are worth more than when I sold the option.  Part of the reason I sold in the first place was because Oracle was a bit overweight in my portfolio.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3982378423269634282/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3982378423269634282' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3982378423269634282'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3982378423269634282'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/why-i-sold-oracle-and-how-i-wiped-out.html' title='Why I sold Oracle and how I wiped out my option profit'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5077602876018059391</id><published>2007-09-21T11:43:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-09-21T12:53:24.447-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>My letter to Congress on H.R. 1852</title><content type='html'>Senators Boxer and Feinstein,
&lt;p&gt;
I urge you in the strongest terms to vote no on H.R. 1852, which is titled the "Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007".  It would be a bad idea for American homeowners and a disaster for California.
&lt;p&gt;
The United States and particularly California are experiencing a housing crisis that is resulting in a number of families losing their homes.  Lately, we've been seeing stories on the news of people who have taken a severe financial hit because they cannot pay their mortgages.  But the crisis didn't begin this year or last.  It started about seven years ago when the cost of buying a house began to rise faster than the income of potential home buyers.
&lt;p&gt;
For instance, although my family income is above the median for Los Angeles County, it would cost me well over half of my gross pay to buy the median house in this county.  Despite very generous pay increases from my employer and my wife starting a part-time job, home ownership has become increasingly less obtainable for us over the last seven years.  Financially and mathematically, it just doesn't make sense.
&lt;p&gt;
Now H.R. 1852, which was co-sponsored my own Representative Adam Schiff and recently passed the House, seems a gallant , but ultimately foolish attempt to solve the problem.  This bill only addresses the problem of providing financing for expensive houses such as the L.A. County median house, and it does nothing to either lower the cost of buying a house or increase the income of prospective home buyers.  That's a bit like trying to fix the Social Security system by issuing lottery tickets instead of checks--some people will be helped out, but most will be worse off.
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately, we got into this mess because lenders made it easier for people to borrow money, so some people took advantage and spent more on houses then they should have.  To those folks, I suppose making it easier for new buyers to take those homes off their hands seems like a pretty good deal.  However, to those of us who are able to finance the purchase a house, but don't want to wreck our financial futures that way, this bill is slap in the face and an insult to our intelligence.
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you,&lt;br&gt;

No doubt you are hearing from constituents who want you to do something, anything, to ease the housing pain in California.  Some of them have have been cheated or deceived those they trusted to give good financial advice.  Others are finding it more difficult to make a living in the housing industry.  While this bill might help their current pain, it will be at the expense of the majority of Americans who have resisted the temptation.  Please show the same restraint, by voting no on this bill.

While this was disappointing, it didn't surprise me too much and I was able to sell my shares at $13.      On an annualized basis, I earned 23.30% on the transaction.  Not a disaster by any means, but not the profit I was hoping for.  At several points after it became clear the transaction was falling apart, I could have panicked and sold at a loss.  But I was able to stay (relatively) calm and evaluate what I should do next.
&lt;p&gt;
Now I might very well have ended up with a loss anyway.  Staying calm doesn't guarantee a good return.  But it does give you a chance to avoid loss when the situation turns against you.  When I bought BNS, I gave it a 95% chance of making $13.62 a share, which I suspect was a bit generous.  I also was aware I might need to sell at $12 a share or less.  I'd even considered the possibility that this position might be worth nothing.  Being aware of the range of possibilities helped me remain calm and step off of the ship when the tide was high, not low.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4510147668167859163/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4510147668167859163' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4510147668167859163'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4510147668167859163'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/why-i-sold-bns-holding.html' title='Why I sold BNS Holding'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1231707932459554597</id><published>2007-08-30T15:09:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-08-30T15:32:31.866-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQAD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQID'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Why I sold a $20 September call option on Oracle</title><content type='html'>Yesterday I sold a $20 September call option part of my Oracle shares for 55¢ a share.

For a long time, this looked like a bad idea.  Thankfully, I've had a number of other investment options that have turned in more than adequate returns while I waited for the market to crash.  The question now is whether or not those investments will come out of the bear market with less damage than the index fund does.
&lt;p&gt;
Since I started my timing strategy experiment, I've had some time to think about how the yield curve telegraphs a bear market.  In theory, the curve should always slope up mildly as the term of a bond increases.  So a 30-year bond should always have a higher yield than a 10-year bond which should yield more than a 3-month bond.  There are technical reasons why the relationship might not hold for some ranges all the time, but eventually the standard curve should be in force most of the time.  An inverted curve, therefore, serves as a warning sign that something is wrong in the financial markets.

What, exactly, goes wrong to mess up the yield curve?

There isn't really much news here except that L'Oreal has hurt Sally by pulling products from Beauty Systems Group's (BSG).  In the spring L'Oreal bought Beauty Alliance, a BSG competitor, so it no longer made sense for them to continue selling through another company.  The bad news is that this has cost Sally some sales and dropped the price of Sally shares to their when-issued price.
&lt;p&gt;
The ugly news, which isn't really news to anyone, is Sally's rather massive debt load.  On the conference call, there were some questions about how quickly the debt can be retired.  Unsurprisingly, the covenants for the senior notes limit the speed Sally can pay off higher interest junior notes.  So the debt may be with us for many years.  Remember that the debt lowers net earnings, but also lowers taxes.  Enterprise value is about $10 a share higher than the current stock price because of the debt load.  A  company representative on the call said something like, "We are in the beauty supply distribution business, not the bond trading business."  At the moment, cash flow more than covers debt service, so the result is ugly not outright bad.
&lt;p&gt;
Now for the good news.  I think the L'Oreal moves are a net positive for Sally Beauty in the long run.  When Alberto-Culver spun off Sally, one of the primary reasons was that the association hurt the BSG business.  Companies such as L'Oreal and Proctor&amp;amp;Gamble weren't happy about using a competitor's  subsidiary to distribute  their products.  Since the split, it appears more brands are interested in being distributed by Sally Beauty, with the obvious exception of L'Oreal.  Since L'Oreal has entered the distribution business, its competitors will have a vested interest in keeping other channels, such as BSG, open so that their products can be sold in salons.
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if L'Oreal's gamble to go into the distribution business will work out, but it seems like a pretty good risk for them.  Conversely, the gamble ought to be good for Sally because although they have lost a major supplier, L'Oreal has essentially taken out a major competitor.  Only if fashion continues to focus on L'Oreal professional products in the next few years will Sally be in serious trouble.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1108724987778108007/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1108724987778108007' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1108724987778108007'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1108724987778108007'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/08/sally-beauty-good-bad-and-ugly.html' title='Sally Beauty: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6020495090613760946</id><published>2007-08-14T10:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-08-14T10:07:12.933-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GOOG'/><title type='text'>Technorati Profile</title><content type='html'>I now have a &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/claim/j55cqmg227" rel="me"&gt;Technorati Profile&lt;/a&gt;.

For a stock market investor, these valuation methods seem pretty basic.  "The Cost Approach" is pretty much book value, "The Sales Comparison Approach v2.0" is a relative valuation close to P/B ratio, and "The Income Capitalization Approach" is a stable value DCF model.  I'd like to take the third and try to get a value for the little guest house my family rents.
&lt;p&gt;
First, we pay $1,200 a month or $14,400 a year to rent our 2 bedroom/1 bath house.  It's about 900 square feet on what would be a relatively small lot, if it were separate from the main house.  Our landlord hasn't raised rent in 5 years and is willing to pay for normal repairs.  I don't know what his expenses are, but I would imagine it would be no more than the 45% of his rental income.  So his cash flow is something like $7,920 a year.
&lt;p&gt;
In a traditional DCF model, you'd divide that number by the discount rate minus the expected stable growth rate.  In the real estate model, those rates are combined to create a standard "cap rate".  Nearly every home will have a stable rental growth rate that matches inflation or 2-3%.  The discount rate would depend on what return you might expect to make by investing in a different property in the area or making some other equivalent investment.  Stock market returns are similarly risky and will probably return 10% or so.  That makes 7% a fairly reasonable cap rate.  So if it were possible to buy our house on its own, $113,143 would be the fair value.
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://www.rentometer.com/rentometer/compare/?citystatezip=91107&amp;rent=1200&amp;beds=2&amp;bt=1"&gt;Rentometer&lt;/a&gt;,  the median in our area is $1,700.  That works out to a fair value of just $160,286, which I would gladly pay.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5020598385844419241/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5020598385844419241' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5020598385844419241'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5020598385844419241'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/08/valuing-my-house.html' title='Valuing my house'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-604683285450744623</id><published>2007-08-06T15:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-08-08T14:00:13.111-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SGOIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OAKGX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='DODFX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='VPMAX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RTN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='PTTRX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FEQIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='EXBIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TMCGX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OTCFX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>FundAdvice.com's advice about my funds</title><content type='html'>FundAdvice.com publishes advice on various 401(k) plans, including the one at &lt;a href="http://www.fundadvice.com/401k-help/401k-plans/401k-raytheon.html"&gt;Raytheon&lt;/a&gt;.  A striking aspect of the suggestions is how few funds they picked&amp;mdash;especially for the "Aggressive" portfolio.  My comments on the funds I didn't pick: 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanguard Windsor - 15.18/0.25/38&lt;/li&gt;

If Vanguard PRIMECAP was not offered in the Raytheon plan, Windsor would likely take its place.  Compared to its Vanguard brother, Windsor has slightly underperformed with lower expenses and higher turnover.  I suppose I have slightly more confidence in PRIMECAP compared to Wellington management.

  &lt;li&gt;American Century Small Cap Value - 15.89/1.05/121&lt;/li&gt;

The analogous funds I own are T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock and Turner Emerging Growth.  American Century combines the lower performance of the former and the high expenses and turnover of the later.  It's hard to get excited about that combination.  Small company funds are a definite weak point of the Raytheon plan.

  &lt;li&gt;Real Estate Securities Fund - 27.55/?/?&lt;/li&gt;

This fund is a specialty REIT fund that entered the Raytheon plan on 01/01/2003, which is also the start date for the "5-year return" listed above.  We have almost no other information, including expenses and turnover.  The top holdings don't mean very much to me and I'm not terribly excited about adding Real Estate exposure at the moment.

  &lt;li&gt;BGI EAFE Equity Index - 20.37/0.10/7&lt;/li&gt;

I like index funds, but I already have three actively managed funds that I think do a better job than this index.  The unbeatable thing about index funds is their low turnover and fees, and consistently average returns.  Foreign stock funds are better candidates for actively managed funds that have the ability to out-perform the benchmark.

  &lt;li&gt;Stable Value Fixed Income - 5.09/?/?&lt;/li&gt;

I'm going to assume this is the same fund that is now called the Fixed Income fund.  If not, my comments would likely still apply.  Recently PIMCO made some bad guesses about the bond market that have cost investors a bit of return lately.  But each month (roughly) we hear the thoughts of Bill Gross, the Total Return fund's manager.   In contrast, there is nearly no information about the Fixed Income fund, which is only found in the Raytheon plan.  A bond fund for me serves as a piece of a market timing strategy in which I try to avoid market losses by holding relatively stable bonds.  The yield I earn in times of market risk, such as at the moment, is purely a bonus as far as I'm concerned.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have also put into place a fund allocation scheme that I think I can follow.  With 10 funds, each would have a 10% or so share in my portfolio if I were equally comfortable with their prospects.  But some funds (Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring, Vanguard PRIMECAP, and First Eagle Overseas) deserve an extra share (15%) since they seem better bets than the others.  In order to make rooms, those funds are paired with funds (Turner Emerging Growth, Fidelity Equity-Income, and Oakmark Global) that I don't have as much confidence in which will receive a half share (5%).  If I were to gain greater confidence in a fund (perhaps Value &amp; Restructuring), I could assign it a double share (20%) and pair it with either two half-share funds or eliminate a position altogether.
&lt;p&gt;
Note that this allocation doesn't exactly match the "batting order" I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/08/ten-little-mutual-funds.html"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; last week, even if the pitcher spot is given a greater role based on defense.  Diversification with my IRA holdings knocks down the value of owning Oakmark Global.  I'm not happy with the small company choices Raytheon offers, including the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock, and that segment is well-represented in my IRA.
&lt;p&gt;
I've also designated PIMCO Total Return as my "gateway fund".  It receives all deposits initially and diverts them to funds that are getting underweight.  I had planned on using another fund for this purpose, but I just learned that the redemption fee for short-term trading is no longer going to be charged.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/604683285450744623/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=604683285450744623' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/604683285450744623'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/604683285450744623'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/08/fundadvicecoms-advice-about-my-funds.html' title='FundAdvice.com&apos;s advice about my funds'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4005945626161141780</id><published>2007-08-02T15:55:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-08-04T02:05:03.529-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SGOIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OAKGX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='DODFX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='VPMAX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RTN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='PTTRX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FEQIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='EXBIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TMCGX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='OTCFX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>Ten little mutual funds</title><content type='html'>It's been a very long time since I looked at my 401(K) options.  I have a hard time talking about these funds because there isn't a lot going on with them.  Unlike a stock like Canon which has more news each week than I could possibly comment on, mutual funds barely look different from one year to the next.  So I thought it might be fun to look at the 10 funds I currently hold as if they were a baseball lineup.  The statistics are 5-year return/expense ratio/turnover ratio.  Higher is better for return (obviously) and lower is better for the other two.  The lineup (with the exception of the pitcher spot) is roughly the order I feel comfortable with these funds in the future.  Overseas funds belong in the outfield, small-cap funds are middle infielders, large-cap funds play corner infield, index and bond funds play catcher, and the special-situation fund is pitcher.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;First Eagle Overseas - 23.04/0.89/28 (CF)&lt;/li&gt;

Jean-Marie Eveillard is once again the manager of this wide-ranging fund.  He recently replaced Charles de Vaulx, who left for some reason I've never found out, but he'd had 26 years managing the fund before his premature retirement.  Currently the fund is most heavily invested in cash and gold, so it ought to be able to invest in bargains as the markets head south.  Some of the bigger holdings are international brands such as Nestle, Toyota, Shimano, and L'Oreal, but many more or obscure to me at least.  In many ways having a fund managed by a Frenchman is more diversifying than yet another New York or U.S. based fund.

 &lt;li&gt;T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock - 15.71/0.91/20 (SS)&lt;/li&gt;

Gregory A. McCrickard has led this fund for 15 years.  The five year return looks good until you compare it to the small-cap stock universe or the funds in this category.  Both sport returns several percentage points higher.  Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of choices for investing in small companies offered by my 401(k) plan.  Small-cap investing ought to be where active management shines, so I'd like to get at least one fund in the mix even if it isn't the best in category.  Both the management fee and turnover signal that the T. Rowe Price fund is a better bet than the Turner fund listed below.

 &lt;li&gt;Vanguard PRIMECAP - 17.53/0.31/10 (1B)&lt;/li&gt;

PRIMECAP is managed by a company of the same name based in Pasadena.  Howard B. Schow, one of six credited managers, gets a cameo in the most recent revision of &lt;i&gt;The Intelligent Investor&lt;/i&gt; discussing the idea that management ought to be held accountable for the goals they establish for themselves.  It's not a good sign when a manager talks up margins until they start to contract and talks about sales growth instead.  I like this fund both for its exceptional performance, but also for its very low expenses and turnover.  Among its top holdings are Oracle, Adobe, FedEx, Microsoft, Sony, and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.  There are a lot of good ideas in there, but I wish I knew more about how the companies are picked.

 &lt;li&gt;Dodge &amp; Cox International Stock - 24.72/0.66/9 (RF)&lt;/li&gt;

This fund is managed by a team, which ought to help when allocating the fund's large and growing asset-base.  One fairly recent addition to the portfolio is a Norwegian energy and aluminum company called Norsk Hydro ASA.  There are also names like Nokia, Honda, News Corp., Shell, Bayer, and Volvo that most Americans will know.  The fund seems to be widely recommended and has done exceptionally well, so it runs the risk of growing larger than its ideas.  Thankfully the expense and turnover ratios bode well for the future.

 &lt;li&gt;Oakmark Global - 22.44/1.18/41 (LF)&lt;/li&gt;

Clyde S. McGregor has managed Oakmark Global for most of the last five years and added Robert A. Taylor as a co-manager two years ago.  International funds have been a particularly easy category to make money in recently, so I have some concern this team is not as good as its record.  But it is a very good record and I suspect that global funds will continue to outperform their more limited brethren.  The expense ratio is pretty high, but since this is a newer fund it might creep down in time.  Also, I'm happy to continue paying for exceptional performance.  Oracle is one of the fund's larger holdings which makes my overweighted position in the software company overweighteder as I add to the fund.

 &lt;li&gt;Raytheon - 15.5/0.00/0 (DH)&lt;/li&gt;

I no longer closely follow Raytheon, but from the inside we seem to be doing fairly well.  A few years ago, we were allowed to diversify away from company stock in the company 401(k), which I take full advantage of.  Despite raising the dividend recently, Raytheon's yield has dropped from 2.66% in 2004 to 1.82% today.

 &lt;li&gt;S&amp;P 500 Index - 10.73/0.01/4 &amp; PIMCO Total Return - 4.84/0.43/257 (C)&lt;/li&gt;

This platoon is my basic market timing experiment.  The S&amp;P 500 index fund is the cheapest way to participate in bull markets and PIMCO is a fairly safe place to earn bond yields when there is a bear market.  I've been invested in the bond portion of this position for &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/01/why-im-buying-pimco-total-return-bond.html"&gt;a year and a half&lt;/a&gt; based on an inverted yield curve.  I've missed out on some nifty gains (though only in this position), but PIMCO Total Return and Raytheon are the only two investment that have not lost money over the last month.  I don't plan to switch back to stocks until the yield curve returns to a more normal configuration.

 &lt;li&gt;Turner Emerging Growth - 19.81/1.54/78 (2B)&lt;/li&gt;

Frank L. Sustersic and William C. McVail are closing in on 10 years running this fund and Heather McMeekin was hired five years ago.  Like the T. Rowe Price fund, I've focused on Emerging Growth in order to have small companies represented in my fund portfolio.  Five-year return looks great, but the expenses and turnover are a concern.  Cash represents 12% of fund assets at the moment and I don't recognize many of the stock holdings.  Deckers Outdoor Corporation, which makes Teva sandals and Uggs boots, stands out as a large holding I recognize.  Almost a quarter of the stocks my market value are industrial materials manufacturers according to Morningstar.

 &lt;li&gt;Fidelity Equity-Income - 13.80/0.67/24 (3B)&lt;/li&gt;

Equity-Income has been on my radar for a very long time, but it isn't terribly exciting so I haven't started building a position until recently.  Stephen R. Petersen has served as manager of this fund for 14 years, so he can certainly take credit for its current record.   The current yield is 1.56%, which doesn't seem particularly high for an "Income" fund.  On the other hand, expenses are reasonable and the fund has outperformed the market since the peak of the internet bubble of 2000.  I won't bore you with the names of the top investments because they are exactly what you would expect this sort of fund to own.  I don't plan on letting this be a large part of my 401(k), but it seems a reasonably defensive choice.

 &lt;li&gt;Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring - 19.18/0.84/13 (P)&lt;/li&gt;

This fund is actually my favorite fund in the bunch which I saved until last because I don't know what to do with it.  David J. Williams, the fund's manager for 15 years, has focused on companies that are experiencing some sort of shift either internally or within their industry.  For instance, he bought Tyco after the story of its extravagant CEO brought down the price and continues to hold some of the companies that spun off Tyco earlier this year.  He also invested in Deluxe Corp., which dominated the paper check business and is now struggling to find new sources of revenue.  These deals don't always work out, but the fund's performance is pretty exceptional.  I think if I were forced to pick just one fund to hold, it would be this one.  Special situation investing can be more laborious and error-prone than simply buying big companies with good earnings, so I don't mind paying the very reasonable fees.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My favorite funds are those that open up the black box just enough for investors to take a peek inside.  My 401(k) doesn't have many funds that are as open as Pimco has been over the years, so I need to search a bit more than I'd like to get to know the managers and their styles.  Ten funds seems like a lot when compared to the more compact portfolio of my IRA and much of that is due to the sparse information available.  I don't want to assign strict 10% allocations to these funds, since they vary in quality and likelihood to outperform.  I think this post will help me sort out what the final allocation ought to be.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4005945626161141780/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4005945626161141780' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4005945626161141780'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4005945626161141780'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/08/ten-little-mutual-funds.html' title='Ten little mutual funds'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5249630874816988260</id><published>2007-07-31T12:17:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-08-01T12:36:00.496-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>My miserable July</title><content type='html'>This is the portion of the show where I normally discuss my exceptional portfolio return and modestly claim the results were the result of "good luck" or some one-time event that can never be repeated.  My IRA was down 5.20% in July, which was on top of a -1.92% return for June.  So which stocks ought I to have sold to avoid this calamity?  Oracle, my largest holding, was down a modest 2.99%.  Canon clocked down 9.48%.  Select Comfort only lost 1.73% in July but for the last 3 months it has lost 14.02%.  Berkshire nearly held steady at -0.66%.  First Marblehead was the biggest loser: trimming 14.7%.  Sally Beauty lost 10.78% and its brother, Alberto-Culver, lost 0.84%.  So it was a clean sweep&amp;mdash;everything lost market capitalization in July.  Here's how I compared to my benchmarks so far this year:
&lt;pre&gt;
Date     S&amp;P 500 Delta   IRA   Delta  BRK A
07/31/07   2.61% -3.32% -0.71% -0.72% 0.01%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To be honest, I don't feel that holding onto these positions was a mistake.  Each of these companies have performed well in my opinion and will likely rebound when the market starts to calm down a bit.  First Marblehead in particular is wildly undervalued because of its perceived connection to mortgage bonds and other asset backed securities.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5249630874816988260/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5249630874816988260' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5249630874816988260'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5249630874816988260'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-miserable-july.html' title='My miserable July'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8609289931167665378</id><published>2007-07-31T11:16:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-31T11:34:55.468-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BNSIA'/><title type='text'>Update on BNS Holding</title><content type='html'>BNSIA has dropped to $10.50 a share from $12.75 just before the new reverse split procedure was &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/bns-holdings-changes-rules-in-mid.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last Friday.  My guess is that 100% of the price cut is panic selling from people like me who bought shares for a quick cash-out.  Most of us will probably not be cashed out unless the procedure is based on beneficial owners not shareholders of record.
&lt;p&gt;
Now my broker sent a message indicating that my shares will be cashed out sometime after the record date on August 2.  Until then, I can't be sure that my shares won't be aggregated.  So I'm pursuing another tact.  
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/bns-holdings-changes-rules-in-mid.html"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; I sent to BNS Holding on Friday resulted in a fairly quick response on Monday from one of the company's directors.  This morning I was able to return his phone call and we talked about the situation for a few minutes.  One of the good things about investing in very small companies is that you might actually have a chance to talk to principle people.  Imagine trying to talk with a director of Oracle, for instance.  At any rate, we had a good chat and the upshot is that I plan on sitting tight.
&lt;p&gt;
One thing this director mentioned is that the proxy that was mailed to shareholders was different than the one published by EDGAR.  I don't really know how that happened, but since the proxy that was actually voted on contained language that allowed the company to aggregate shares, the SEC probably won't have a problem with the company's actions and disclosure.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that BNS Holding is aware of the issue and the director I talked to seemed willing to work on straightening it out.  The bottom line seems to be that it's more trouble than it is worth to them to have a small disgruntled shareholder such as myself.  (I can't decide if my letter was overly threatening or if that was one of the reasons it got noticed.  If this situation happens with a different company, I plan to go easy for the initial contact at least.)
&lt;p&gt;
I should also mention, that holding on to the company wouldn't be a terrible bet.  I haven't done a valuation, but &lt;a href="http://www.collinsind.com/pdf_files/BNS_Annual_Meeting.pdf"&gt;company presentation&lt;/a&gt; at the annual meeting seemed very promising.  This week represents the best and final opportunity to buy shares for a very long time.  I'm mildly temped though I think it's just the lure of scarcity talking.
&lt;p&gt;
Once again, I think the key here is to not panic.  I took a few moments to get my strategy in order and I acted in a way that kept my options open.  I'm still 95% sure my shares will be cashed out sooner or later, but I would certainly have lost money if I'd immediately sold on Friday.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8609289931167665378/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8609289931167665378' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8609289931167665378'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8609289931167665378'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/update-on-bns-holding.html' title='Update on BNS Holding'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3975849133160021699</id><published>2007-07-27T09:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-27T13:32:40.528-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BNSIA'/><title type='text'>BNS Holding changes the rules in mid-stream</title><content type='html'>Here is the text of a complaint I just filed with the SEC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
BNS announced a 1-for-200 reverse split that was intended to result in fewer then 300 shareholders of record.  This would allow the company to "go private".  Shareholders of fewer than 200 shares would receive $13.62 in exchange for surrendering their shares.
&lt;p&gt;
According to the proxy statement (&lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/14637/000092189507001188/def14a06281_07192007.htm"&gt;DEF 14A&lt;/a&gt;), the company would not be required by law to cash out holders of shares in street name.  But the company did promise to instruct brokers to treat those shareholders in the same manner as shareholders of record:
&lt;p&gt;
"If your shares are held in street name, under Delaware law the proposed Reverse/Forward Stock Split would not impact your shares. However, we plan to work with brokers and nominees to offer to treat shareholders holding shares in street name in substantially the same manner as shareholders whose shares are registered in their names. To determine the transaction's effect on any shares you hold in street name, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee."
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070727/nyf048.html?.v=101"&gt;the press release&lt;/a&gt; dated a week after the proposal passed a shareholder vote, stockholders holding their shares in street name would NOT be cashed out after all.  The relevant passage is:
&lt;p&gt;
"MIDDLETOWN, R.I., July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- BNS Holding, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: BNSIA - News; the "Company") confirms that the Company has elected to require banks, brokers or other nominee to aggregate any fractional shares within the Depository Trust Company totals upon the consummation of the Company's proposed 200-for-1 reverse stock split immediately followed by a 1-for-200 forward stock split (the "Reverse/Forward Stock Split") scheduled to take effect on August 2, 2007. As a result, the Company need not provide for cash payout to any stockholders holding shares of Common Stock in street name (such as a bank, broker or other nominee). In addition, stockholders holding their shares in street name would retain the same number of shares they held immediately prior to the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. Following the consummation of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split, the Company intends to cease the listing and trading of the Company's Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value per share and Preferred Stock Purchase Rights on the Boston Stock Exchange and cease to be a reporting company pursuant to Sections 12(b) and 12(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended."
&lt;p&gt;
As a result, investors who bought shares in street name with the intention of being cashed out in the reverse split acted using false information from the company.  
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, shareholders who wished to remain shareholders may have performed unneeded transactions.  Here is the advice from the company's proxy:
&lt;p&gt;
"      If you would otherwise be a Cashed Out Shareholder as a result of your owning fewer than 200 shares of Common Stock, but you would rather continue to hold Common Stock after the Reverse/Forward Stock Split and not be cashed out, you may do so by taking either of the following actions:
&lt;p&gt;
      o  Purchase a sufficient number of additional shares of Common Stock on the open market and have them registered in your name and consolidated with your current record account, if you are a record holder, or have them entered in your account with a nominee (such as your broker or bank) in which you hold your current shares so that you hold at least 200 shares of Common Stock in your record account immediately before the Effective Date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split; or
&lt;p&gt;
      o  If applicable, consolidate your accounts so that together you hold at least 200 shares of Common Stock in one record account immediately before the Effective Date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split.
&lt;p&gt;
      You will have to act far enough in advance so that the purchase of any Common Stock and/or consolidation of your accounts containing Common Stock is completed by the close of business prior to the Effective Date of the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. The Effective Date is the date upon which the Certificates of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation become effective and may not be prior to the date of the Annual Meeting."
&lt;p&gt;
If BNS intended for shares held in street name to not be cashed out, the company ought to have stated that in the proxy.  Many companies follow that procedure and I don't see anything wrong with that.  But there something wrong with announcing one procedure before a shareholder vote and announcing another after the proposal has already passed.  It is a form of bait and switch.
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that BNS should be required to honor the earlier statement and work with brokers to cash out all shareholders of fewer than 200 shares whether those shares are registered in street name or not.
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you,&lt;br&gt;
Jon
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My next step is to talk to my broker about what is likely to happen to my shares.  I don't believe it will be possible to register them in my name.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;
The company has more information about the shareholder meeting at &lt;a href="http://www.collinsind.com/bns_shareholder_meeting.asp"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.  Besides recording the results of the vote, the only thing I've found pertaining to this issue is the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is the Company’s intent that following the reverse/forward split
that the Company will initiate the steps necessary to terminate the
registration of our shares of Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the
Securities and Exchange Act as last amended. As such, our obligations to
file Form 10-K, and Form 10-Q, and the like will be immediately
suspended within 10 days of the consummation of the reverse/forward
split. This will be an advantage to the Company for a variety of reasons,
inclusive of controlling the dissemination of certain business information,
elimination of costs associated with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
and elimination of the initial and continuing costs of compliance with
Sarbanes-Oxley and related regulations. The Company intends that future
financial information will be made available to our stockholders regularly
and on a timely basis via our websites www.collinsindustries.com and
www.bnsholding.com.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second website isn't currently live.
&lt;h2&gt;Update #2:&lt;/h2&gt;
I just sent a fax to the company's investor relations that included the text of my SEC complaint and the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don't know if the SEC will be able to take action on my complaint between now and August 2, but there is still time to correct this unfair procedure, or to cancel or delay the Reverse/Forward Stock Split. As can be seen in today's trading (share price is down by over 10%), this mornings press release has had an averse effect on the market value of this company. Further, the procedure revealed this morning may permanently harm the rights of minority owners without proper compensation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.hoovers.com/bns/--ID__10241--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml"&gt;According to Hoover's&lt;/a&gt;, the fax number is 401-848-6444.  Depending on what my broker recommends, I may also try calling the phone number that is listed (401-848-6300).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3975849133160021699/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3975849133160021699' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3975849133160021699'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3975849133160021699'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/bns-holdings-changes-rules-in-mid.html' title='BNS Holding changes the rules in mid-stream'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1365016892624972886</id><published>2007-07-26T10:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T17:54:04.303-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SAP'/><title type='text'>Select Comfort levering up</title><content type='html'>Select Comfort released their &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97149&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1030864&amp;highlight="&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quarter results&lt;/a&gt; and there isn't anything too surprising there.  We already knew sales would be down and they were.  Same-store sales dropped 14% from last year, which isn't good any way you look at it.  But we've know it was coming for &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/select-comforts-problems-deepen.html"&gt;a month now&lt;/a&gt;, so that shouldn't be the focus today.
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing I notice is that gross profit margin has not suffered.  It improved from 60.4% to 61.2% which indicates management has not panicked and slashed prices.  Operating margin on the other hand has plummeted because of lower sales and increases in sales, marketing, and R&amp;amp;D.  So looking at the &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/search?q=%22four+factors%22"&gt;Four Factors&lt;/a&gt;, profit margin is lower over the last twelve months (4.78%) than in 2006 (5.85%).  &lt;a href="http://www.pencils2.com/cgi-bin/blog/view_post/218731"&gt;David Kretzmann&lt;/a&gt; points out that the effect is "sacrificing short-term results for the long-term strength of the business."  If those ad and research dollars are well spent, Select Comfort ought to reap a good return on investment over the next few quarters.
&lt;p&gt;
Moving on to the balance sheet, it's striking how much smaller the asset base has become since the beginning of the year.  Select Comfort has shed $77.5 million of cash and marketable securities in that time.  As a result, the sales to assets ratio has actually improved from 3.52 to 4.82 despite lower absolute revenue.  There didn't seem to be much need for the money on the balance sheet, so most of it was returned to shareholders via a repurchase program.  Turning to the liabilities side, management borrowed $10 million to buy even more shares.  Altogether, Select Comfort has bought back $94.3 million of shares at an average price of $17.46 a share.  As a result, assets to equity has improved from 1.89 to 3.75 which further leverages the business.
&lt;p&gt;
Current and prospective investors need to understand what this is&amp;mdash;this is a "bet the business" moment by management.  If sales pick up over the rest of the year, the boost to Select Comfort's value will be dramatic.  But if sales continue to fall, expect share prices plummet even further and there won't be a cash cushion or a buyout offer to ease the pain.  So far there is enough cash flow and not enough debt to worry about the price going to zero, but Select Comfort is significantly riskier than it has been in several years.
&lt;p&gt;
Is management making a good gamble?  There are several reasons to think so.  When Select Comfort released their new TV ads, &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/select-comforts-new-ad-direction.html"&gt;I had high hopes&lt;/a&gt;.  But since they haven't worked, the company has reverted to the original Sleep Number campaign for most markets.  The old ads have worked in the past and there's no reason they won't work again.  Next, the bed maker is rolling out some product updates that seem to target customers tempted by foam beds.  Finally, the company is close to finishing their SAP integration.  I hadn't grasped the full significance of the system until today: it will make international expansion possible.  Select Comfort already sells some mattresses in Canada through a partner, but if they can start opening stores in Europe and maybe Asia, the growth will be astronomical.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1365016892624972886/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1365016892624972886' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1365016892624972886'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1365016892624972886'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/select-comfort-levering-up.html' title='Select Comfort levering up'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-536943616187733308</id><published>2007-07-23T11:01:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-23T17:14:50.234-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='QSLGW'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Select Comfort option expired</title><content type='html'>So Select Comfort ended last week under $17.50, so the call option I sold expired worthless.  As I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/option-expiration-tomorrow.html"&gt;mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be on the lookout for a chance to sell another option soon.  One issue is that the company releases 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon.  Selling a call option before then is at least partially a bet on there being no upside surprises in that release.  I don't like to speculate on what is basically unknowable, so I will likely pass on the premium until Thursday at the soonest.  If by some chance, the news on Wednesday exceeds my expectations, I might look at a higher strike price on later dated options.
&lt;p&gt;
One problem with selling call options on Select Comfort is that roughly &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SCSS"&gt;a quarter of the outstanding shares&lt;/a&gt; are sold short.  That's a lot of buying potential if relatively good news causes short sellers to unwind their positions.  Paradoxically, extreme short interest tends to be a positive sign for companies that aren't &lt;a href="http://asensio.com/"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://ml-implode.com/"&gt;on the way to bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.  All those short-sellers are going to need to buy back shares sooner or later, which means extra demand at some point down the road.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/536943616187733308/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=536943616187733308' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/536943616187733308'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/536943616187733308'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/select-comfort-option-expired.html' title='Select Comfort option expired'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1811673898761265985</id><published>2007-07-19T13:06:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-19T16:02:17.933-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='QSLGW'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Option expiration tomorrow</title><content type='html'>The call option against my Select Comfort shares expires tomorrow.  Since the stock ended at $17.20, it must gain 1.7% tomorrow.  Of the 1,685 trading days in my database, a little over a 1/4 have resulted in 1.7% or greater gain.  So I must face the possibility that my shares will be called away.  If so, the proceeds ought to be reinvested, though probably not in Select Comfort.  My &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/select-comforts-problems-deepen.html"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; on selling the option remains intact and First Marblehead has gotten even cheaper.
&lt;p&gt;
The July option ended the day at 5¢ or essentially worthless.  August $17.50 options ended at 70¢, so I may collect another nice premium next week if the shares are not called away.  At this point Select Comfort is on a short leash for me, so I plan to continue selling options until the business improves.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1811673898761265985/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1811673898761265985' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1811673898761265985'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1811673898761265985'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/option-expiration-tomorrow.html' title='Option expiration tomorrow'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5703282679925352890</id><published>2007-07-16T11:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-16T21:12:31.562-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BNSIA'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='QSLGW'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Relative performance</title><content type='html'>Here is a quick look at the relative performance of my open positions:

&lt;p&gt;
A few notes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.QSLGW is my Select Comfort option.  Unlike the other positions, I left out the option commission from calculating the S&amp;amp;P return.  Options create so much leverage that I can pay a larger percentage of the cost in commissions and still make a profit.  For instance, I paid $9.96 in order to get a $45 premium.  That means my commission cost was 22% of the initial position.  Ordinarily anything more that 1-2% is crippling to an investment, so no one would make the imaginary index purchase that corresponds to the call option.  Going-private positions can sometimes have a similar issue, but never so extreme.
&lt;li&gt;The longer a position is open, the more out-performance "points" it might collect.  On an annualized basis, Canon and the Alberto-Culver investments surpass my original Oracle position, but they have not been in my portfolio as long.
&lt;li&gt;More recent positions are more strongly influenced by luck.  If the news lately has been more bad than good (Select Comfort, First Marblehead, and Sally Beauty) or neutral (Berkshire), the return might be lower than might be expected.
&lt;li&gt;Despite the interesting ways it got there, my initial Select Comfort position has more or less matched the market average since I bought it.
&lt;li&gt;My success so far has come from avoiding losses.  My big winners (Canon and Oracle) are solid, but not overly spectacular performers.  The truly spectacular winners (options, going-private transactions, and spin-offs) are small portions of the overall portfolio, but do provide some boost.
&lt;li&gt;

Today, I read about Sprint's efforts to improve &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/535/story/1295542.html"&gt;customer quality&lt;/a&gt; by releasing problem customers from their contracts.  A customer that calls support several times &lt;i&gt;a day&lt;/i&gt; is clearly a customer that is not worth keeping.  The letter makes the point a bit more lightly: "While we have worked to resolve your issues and questions to the best of our ability, the number of inquiries you have made to us during this time has led us to determine that we are unable to meet your wireless needs."  One imagines these customers will be relieved to be let off the hook as well.
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes companies ought to be selective in the people they take money from in order to avoid lower profit customers.  Cutting off problem clients may be too extreme, but there are ways to attract "good" customers and avoid the bad.  For instance, targeted advertising or limiting service to certain regions.  Insurance companies and lenders often reject potential clients based on risk assessment.  But the simplest solution is to charge higher prices.  It isn't snobbish.  People who pay more tend to be better customers if only because they are more profitable upfront.
&lt;p&gt;
With that in mind, let's turn to the mattress industry, which is in a rough patch due  to the slowdown in home sales.  Since mattress purchases can be delayed, consumers may chose to wait if they are worried about their financial future.  As a result, mattress companies face the prospect of slowing sales.  Select Comfort has refused to lower prices in order to boost sales and instead has focused on improving marketing and product features.  On the other hand, &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/07/11/restless-times-at-sealy.aspx"&gt;Sealy&lt;/a&gt; has been offering discounts that average over 10%.  As a result, Sealy's sold more and Select Comfort sold fewer mattresses.
&lt;p&gt;
Score one for Sealy, right?  Not exactly.  When you buy a mattress you are paying for the mattress itself, the brand on the label, &lt;a href="http://www.minyanville.com/articles/index.php?a=13331"&gt;possibly status&lt;/a&gt;, a short trial period, and a warranty of 10 to 20 years.  In exchange, the company gets paid a premium upfront.  If they are lucky, they won't hear from the customer for the next decade or so when they are ready to buy another bed.  A really good customer might buy the company's bed for their children and vacation home, and tell all their friends about what a great mattress they bought.  But for every &lt;a href="http://www.selectcomfort.com/sleep_research/testimonials.cfm"&gt;good customer&lt;/a&gt;, there are several &lt;a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/furniture/select.html"&gt;disgruntled customers&lt;/a&gt;.  Bad reviews are one thing, but Select Comfort also warns, "We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage."
&lt;p&gt;
Besides improving the product, the best defense against unsatisfied and litigious customers a company can deploy is to maximize the profit of the initial sale.  Select Comfort is one part manufacturer, one part marketer, one part retailer, and one part insurer for its own products.  Like any insurer, the temptation to write unprofitable policies during down markets can be difficult to resist.  But resist it must or risk oversized losses for the sake of a few quarters of undersized earnings.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3313303202960122230/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3313303202960122230' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3313303202960122230'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3313303202960122230'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/getting-customers-you-deserve.html' title='Getting the customers you deserve'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5851418658060276720</id><published>2007-07-10T13:49:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-27T13:33:22.059-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BNSIA'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='KGHI'/><title type='text'>Why I bought BNS Holding</title><content type='html'>Yesterday, I bought less than 200 shares of BNS Holding for $12 a share.  On July 19, shareholders will vote on a proposal to pay out $13.62 for partial shares in a 200:1 reverse split.  Since there is a definitive proxy and since insiders control about 44% of the shares, the odds are very high that this transaction will go through.  I put the odds at 95%.  Since the shares traded at $12 a share just before the announcement, I'm getting a free option on the going-private transaction.  My calculations based on the Kelly Criterion show that it would be rational to risk 93% of my funds on this investment.  The worst case (a 5% chase the company falls to $0 instead of $12) would still be worth a 50% bet.  By any standard, this is a good risk.
&lt;p&gt;
Thinking back on it now, I realize that I was a bit harsh on myself for buying Kaiser Group Holdings earlier this year.  My arbitrage spreadsheet shows I estimated there to be a 75% the going-private transaction would occur.  My purchase price implied a 14% chance.  75% was clearly too high in hindsight, but I still think 14% was a bit too low.  Maybe 25 or 30% would have been accurate.  In any case, the investment was well worth the minimal risk based on the Kelly Criterion.  With relatively low odds and a high potential reward, I think I actually made a good decision even though I didn't get the desired outcome.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5851418658060276720/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5851418658060276720' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5851418658060276720'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5851418658060276720'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/why-i-bought-bns-holdings.html' title='Why I bought BNS Holding'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4569741131704118209</id><published>2007-07-09T15:01:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-10T13:44:19.700-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='INTU'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GOOG'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MSFT'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SAP'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CRM'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RNOW'/><title type='text'>Ellison's NetSuite investment</title><content type='html'>Larry Ellison is very close to pushing his NetSuite venture onto the public markets and it's got folks worried about &lt;a href="http://financialskeptic.blogspot.com/2007/07/oracle-is-not-netsuite.html"&gt;a potential conflict of interest&lt;/a&gt;.  Before everyone gets carried-away-er, I'd like to point out that Ellison's fortune is almost fully tied to Oracle, so there is every reason to assume that he will put Oracle shareholders ahead of NetSuite shareholders.  To illustrate, at the moment, Mr. Ellison's Oracle holdings are worth $24.5 billion.  Assuming the NetSuite IPO sells at the high end of its range, his holdings in that company would be about $555 million.  If NetSuite catches up to Salesforce.com in terms of market capitalization, Ellison's investment would be worth about $3.7 billion.  In other words, NetSuite's current contribution to his net worth is a rounding error with the potential to become pocket change.
&lt;p&gt;
Ironically, the horses left the barn two years when Oracle bought Siebel and stepped more firmly in the on-demand side of business software.  Before that, Ellison had reduced his role in NetSuite's operations and ended a licensing deal that allowed NetSuite to use the Oracle name to promote its service.  NetSuite's IPO gives reporters an excuse to write about the situation, but in reality it's just another step on the path of disengaging from the smaller company.  Once there is a public market for his shares, he'll be able to sell part of his stake.
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment, Oracle and NetSuite don't directly compete for business, which means they currently have a symbiotic relationship&amp;mdash;Oracle sells database and middleware software to NetSuite and NetSuite fills a niche that Oracle has left vacant.  But that relationship can't continue much longer.  Hosted business software for small business is the next frontier for any number of software companies including Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and SAP.  In addition, there are established companies like NetSuite, Salesforce.com, RightNow, and Intiut.  So Ellison's two companies are on a collision course and he's jumping off the little ship to ride the bigger one.
&lt;p&gt;
As an Oracle investor, there isn't much to worry about here.  Larry Ellison has far too much invested in Oracle financially, professionally, and personally.  NetSuite offers him and his children an opportunity for a higher return than is currently available with Oracle, but there isn't much chance it will every rival Oracle in absolute terms.  Future NetSuite investors must be aware of the issue, but that's just a part of due diligence.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4569741131704118209/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4569741131704118209' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4569741131704118209'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4569741131704118209'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/07/ellisons-netsuite-investment.html' title='Ellison&apos;s NetSuite investment'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-50438002525310233</id><published>2007-07-03T17:15:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-03T18:25:09.585-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Should we buy a house?</title><content type='html'>In order to answer that question, I'm going to focus on the economics and leave out the (very real) intangible benefits.  That isn't really fair, but it makes more sense to evaluate those things later.
&lt;p&gt;
For the last five years, we have been renting a 2 bedroom/1 bath house for $1200 a month in Pasadena.  Our landlord has not raised rent and has kept up with the needed repairs.  I found a 3 bedroom/3 bath house listed for $2300, which is about what we would like to move into.  It's entirely possible that rent will go up over time, but for the sake of simplicity I'm going to leave out both rent increases and inflation.  Presumably they will cancel each other out on average.
&lt;p&gt;
Both the house we are in now and the 3 bedroom house are guest houses, so I can't determine exactly how much they might go for.  But I'm going to assume we'd have to pay about $600,000 to get something similar.  If that seems high to you, I suggest looking around on the MLS for houses in Pasadena.  It's probably optimistic.  I'll assume commissions are 6% (paid by the buyer in essence) and taxes are 1.25% a year.    Right now 8% seems a reasonable mortgage interest rate.
&lt;p&gt;
An easy way to look at the rent versus buy decision is to figure out what sort of return I'm make as a landlord.  The annual rent to price ratio is 4.6%, which would be a pretty poor rate of return for the landlord, even without considering costs.  Taxes, for instance, lower the rate to 3.35%.  The upfront commission is $36,000, but that can be divided over the number of years we would live there.  For instance, over 10 years, the return would be down to 2.75%.  Then there are repairs, HOA fees, insurance and other fixed costs.  If you are lucky, the return is positive after all that.
&lt;p&gt;
So it's hard to justify making that sort of purchase with cash given that you can buy an ultra-safe 30-year bond that returns 5.15%.  To match that rate, you need to get a rent to price ratio of at least 7%.  That would imply a price of about $400,000.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/50438002525310233'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/50438002525310233'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2581009644009207598</id><published>2007-06-29T13:09:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-06T14:57:34.059-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>How Oracle executes a transaction</title><content type='html'>Oracle's merger process came up in the &lt;a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/39455"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A session&lt;/a&gt; during the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Quarter conference call.  I found the details fascinating.  First, there are immediate cost savings that come from eliminating duplications in general and administrative expenses.  I'm reading between the lines here, but it stands to reason that Oracle is uniquely suited to execute these cost savings.  After all, Oracle makes a business out of installing and upgrading HR, accounting and other G&amp;amp;A systems in order to cut costs.  I'm curious if improved software from SAP and Oracle is one of the reasons M&amp;amp;A activity continues to be so strong this year.
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of cutting sales, and R&amp;amp;D staff, Oracle usually increases spending in these areas.  The companies Oracle has been buying lately are too small to have scaled into global and integrated businesses.  On a standalone basis an application might target US customers that run the Oracle middleware, but with Oracle's scale it might sell to a French customer that uses IBM or a Chinese customer that uses Microsoft.  So Oracle isn't just buying revenue or customers, but also the technology behind its acquisitions.
&lt;p&gt;
Oddly, Oracle isn't able to record the revenue from acquired companies for a few months after the transaction completes.  That's because its revenue recognition policy turns out to be more conservative than the companies it's bought so far.  As a consequence, it takes from 3 to 15 months for an acquisition to settle into "full contribution mode", as Ms. Catz puts it.  That's one of the reasons Oracle's acquisition strategy seemed to have failed initially.  For instance, &lt;a href="http://itinvestmentresearch.com/ora10K.aspx"&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Oracle's application business assumed revenue for the acquired companies would be recognized in the same way after Oracle takes over.

Oracle had an almost perfect 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quarter this year.  I couldn't really find much to complain about, so I was interested to read about &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070626_237400.htm"&gt;"Oracle's Mixed Message"&lt;/a&gt; in BusinessWeek.  Here is the meat of the current bear case in the article:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Oracle's fourth-quarter sales of new business applications licenses, a predictor of future sales, rose just 5% in the region that includes the U.S., to $415 million. Excluding Oracle's $3.3 billion acquisition of Hyperion Solutions on Apr. 23, U.S. sales were essentially flat. "That's where people are a little concerned," says Peter Kuper, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS). 
&lt;p&gt;
During the conference call, Ellison blamed slow U.S. applications sales growth on a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of 2006, when Oracle reported particularly strong results.
&lt;p&gt;
Oracle's overall new license sales for applications rose 13%, to $726 million. UBS (UBS) analyst Heather Bellini said in a research note that new applications license sales fell short of her expectation for 14% growth, and she wants to see more numbers from Oracle's recent acquisitions to figure out how quickly it's picking up share from SAP. Bellini expects SAP to post 10% new license growth for applications in its current quarter.
&lt;p&gt;
Oracle announced five acquisitions during the fourth quarter, including Hyperion Solutions, a maker of business-intelligence software, and Agile Software, which helps companies manage product portfolios (see BusinessWeek.com, 3/2/07, "Oracle: Consolidation Catalyst?"). Oracle said Hyperion contributed $43 million in fourth-quarter sales, but there's concern on Wall Street that chief information officers signed discounted multiyear contracts with Hyperion before the acquisition closed, leaving Oracle with less green field now. "The big question around this acquisition will be, did Hyperion drain the pipeline?" says Brent Thill, director of software research at Citi (C), in an interview earlier in June. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peter Kuper's concern (5% increase in new application license revenue in the Americas) is nitpicking at its finest.  Year over year quarterly results are valid numbers to look at for most companies, but it doesn't work quite so well in a business that is driven by a relatively small number of deals.  It isn't unusual for a sale to finish just before the beginning of the quarter or get delayed past the end of a quarter.  The problem gets exaggerated by looking at fine slices.  Here's what the line looks like for the last two years:
&lt;pre&gt;
                 Fiscal 2006           Fiscal 2007
                 Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  TOTAL Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  TOTAL
US Applications 150% 41% 61% 73%  67%  69% 19% 69%  5%  26%
&lt;/pre&gt;
Clearly growth was incredibly lumpy.  Somehow I don't think Mr. Kuper wasn't highlighting the 69% growth a quarter ago or the 73% growth a year ago.  Looking across all geographies, as Heather Bellini did, smooths the data somewhat:
&lt;pre&gt;
Applications     84% 24% 77% 83%  66%  80% 28% 57% 13%  32%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But there is a deeper problem since analysts are focusing on new licenses, which are increasingly less important to Oracle's profitability.  Since 2002 or so, renewals have accounted for the majority of overall revenue:
&lt;pre&gt;
                2007   2006   2005   2004   2003   2002
Renewal share  58.61% 57.50% 56.58% 56.12% 54.58% 50.19%
&lt;/pre&gt;
Renewal revenue carries a much higher operating margin, since you don't need to woo customers with expensive sales calls to convince them to continue paying for software they've already installed.  Also, renewals are less likely to be discounted.  Overall, it's just a lot cheaper for Oracle to retain a customer than to sign a new customer.  The easiest way to measure renewal rate is to compare the current period's "Software license updates and product support" line to the previous period's total sales:
&lt;pre&gt;
Renewal rate   72.17% 70.44% 66.05% 62.91% 55.71% 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Although this number might not strictly reflect the rate that customers are retained from one year to the next, it's likely to be a pretty good approximation.  It shows that Oracle is getting better and better at holding onto the customers it has already won, which will improve profitability in the long run.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I know why analysts focus on new licenses.  The above quote makes clear that they are "a predictor of future sales".  The last five years shows this to be at least somewhat true:
&lt;pre&gt;
New licenses   19.92% 19.90% 15.53%  8.29% -6.92%
Revenue growth 25.15% 21.87% 16.18%  7.19% -2.05%
&lt;/pre&gt;
On the other hand, by focusing entirely on new licenses, Wall Street is missing the potential growth in revenues, which are growing beyond what would be expected by looking at licenses alone.  The difference is customer retention.

It has been one of the better periods of time to be invested in the US stock market.  Five years is a pretty standard span to measure performance, but I'll feel better about my record after looking at it from trough-to-trough not just trough-to-peak.
&lt;p&gt;
Here is my &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/12/2006-in-review.html"&gt;year-by-year performance&lt;/a&gt; updated to the market close today:

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And here is the graphical version:
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7319907@N05/593012630/" title="Photo Sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1408/593012630_2f5a3b10c6_o.png" width="610" height="288" alt="IRA performance" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The green line labeled "Inflation+10%" represents &lt;a href="http://www.controlledgreed.com/2007/06/how_do_you_defi.html"&gt;a benchmark&lt;/a&gt; suggested over at Controlled Greed.  To measure inflation, I'm using the Bureau of Labor Statistics &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt"&gt;Series CUUR0000SA0&lt;/a&gt;.  As you can see, that's a pretty tough benchmark to beat.  I don't find it to be quite as helpful as the other two benchmarks I use.  I'm beating it now, but what would I do if I weren't?  With the index and Berkshire, I could decide after a few years of under performance to give up stock picking and just buy the benchmark.  But I can't do that with inflation + 10%.
&lt;h3&gt;Update:&lt;/h3&gt;
I took a quick look a the funds my 401(k) plan offers and the only ones that would have beaten my IRA's return over the last five years are First Eagle Overseas (20.91%) and Dodge &amp;amp; Cox International Stock (20.81%).  I have positions in both funds, but I only started buying them recently.  The performance difference is well within the margin of error, so there's no real incentive to switch even if I weren't having fun managing my own portfolio.  Also, I have confidence in my own selections, but I don't have any particular insight into the stocks those funds are holding.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8683229084152378965/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8683229084152378965' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8683229084152378965'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8683229084152378965'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/my-first-five-years.html' title='My first five years'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8565069131887712175</id><published>2007-06-22T12:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-22T14:02:04.342-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='KGHI'/><title type='text'>How I made a small profit on Kaiser Group Holdings</title><content type='html'>As it turns out, I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; make a small profit on the busted Kaiser Group Holdings deal.  This afternoon I sold my 19 shares for $28 a share and netted a $4.59 profit.  After commissions, I would have lost $23.83 if I'd bought the S&amp;amp;P 500.  (Not counting commissions, I would have broken even on the index, but that's not cricket.)
&lt;p&gt;
Besides luck, which is the overwhelming reason I made a profit, I credit this result to waiting for a good price before buying and not panicking before selling.  If I'd sold immediately, I would have been out almost the cost of two commissions.  On an annualized basis, my return was 6.69%, which is nothing to write home about, but better than if it had stayed in cash.  Remember that these short-term deals are intended to beat the rate I earn in my sweep account.

More importantly, I've kept my streak of profitable closed positions alive.  (That a joke, actually.  I got lucky on a bad decision.  Sometimes, it's best to sell a bad decision at a loss.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8565069131887712175/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8565069131887712175' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8565069131887712175'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8565069131887712175'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-i-made-small-profit-on-kaiser-group.html' title='How I made a small profit on Kaiser Group Holdings'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8201858138335692295</id><published>2007-06-21T12:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-21T13:14:37.836-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SGOIX'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RTN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Eveillard's tax device</title><content type='html'>I just came across an &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/19/pf/funds/eveillard.fortune/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Jean-Marie Eveillard, who manages one of my 401(k) mutual funds&amp;mdash;First Eagle Overseas.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fortune: You pay a lot of attention to companies' tax rates. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;

Particularly in the U.S., I don't like companies with very low tax rates, because it's a sign either that the Internal Revenue Service will catch up with them someday or that the profits they report are overstated.

The average corporate tax rate is 35%. Any company that has a tax rate of 15% or 20% looks suspicious to me. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This suggests a simple device for estimating how much risk a company has because of trying to game the tax system.  Companies with overly low tax rates are like ticking time-bombs.  There aren't a lot of positive reasons for a company to pay low taxes.  The device also warns of companies that exploit the US system that allows companies to use two sets of books.  Oracle has the highest rating and it isn't exactly a blaring fire alarm.

The Tilson Dividend Fund uses covered call options to simulate dividends for stocks that don't pay up.  After all, if your focus is on current income, constantly writing options provides a premium stream that simulates a dividend stream.  Clearly, the analogy breaks down in a few places&amp;mdash;underlying shares can't be called away with true dividends and other investors don't perceive the synthetic dividend you've created.
&lt;p&gt;
The Dividend Fund also uses covered call writing to get paid for doing what it planned to do anyway.  Instead of just selling a position, the fund will sometimes sell a call option with a strike at or above the intrinsic value.  I call this a soft sell, since there is a chance that you won't be able to sell at the price you want.  On the plus side, you can collect a stream of premiums while you wait.
&lt;p&gt;
I've &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/my-stock-option-insurance-business.html"&gt;already discussed&lt;/a&gt; my concept of options as insurance.  In this analogy, the idea is to write options that will, on average, compensate for their risk with sufficient premiums.  The premiums become float that can be invested.  Conservative underwriting and careful risk analysis (usually using statistics) are keys to success.  The slightly odd thing about covered calls is that the payout consists of the asset that is being protected.  It would be like GM starting an insurance company that replaced totaled vehicles rather than paying cash.
&lt;p&gt;
At its root, the covered call strategy depends on the bird in the hand being worth more than any potential birds in the bush.  Meanwhile stock investments are made when the birds in the bush seem more valuable than the bird in the bush.  This means that the practice of buy-write covered calls, where the stock is bought mostly for its attractive call price, contains a subtle inconsistency.  Either the stock is worth buying now or it is not.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8273784252591902297'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8273784252591902297'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3021465408883473742</id><published>2007-06-18T15:36:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-10T16:37:35.599-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='QSLGW'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Why I sold a call option on Select Comfort</title><content type='html'>I already mentioned my intension to sell a covered call option at $17.50 a share and today the order was filled at 45¢ a share.  I sold &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=QSLGW.X"&gt;July contracts&lt;/a&gt; and the underlying stock ended the day at $16.68.  Over the next 31 days, there is a 42% or so chance the option will be exercised.

&lt;p&gt;
The odds that I will break even are approximately 62%.

&lt;p&gt;
It's important to note that I've only written an option for a portion of my holdings, which means I can still profit from price increases over the next month.  I might sell another option at a higher strike or an option that expires later in the year.  It's also possible that I will sell shares outright if their price jumps unexpectedly.  On the other hand, I could have sold options more cheaply if I'd sold more contracts.
&lt;p&gt;
Is seems to me that Select Comfort is undervalued because of a convergence of events that management has some control over.  At a recent &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?p=irol-eventDetails&amp;c=97149&amp;eventID=1564564"&gt;Analyst Conference&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Bill McLaughlin pointed out that the current marketing campaign does a good job addressing the "need" portion of Select Comfort's message, but not the "solution" portion.  He mentioned at least twice that consumers don't always know where to buy the Sleep Number bed, which I found a bit surprising.  He also said that the housing downturn has had an effect on sales since Labor Day last year because people tend to buy beds when they move into a new house and because the "wealth effect" has been reduced.  He also revealed that Select Comfort has seen significantly more cannibalization than expected when it expand from 100 Retail Partner Doors last year to 800 this year.
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, management has committed to fixing these problems and to borrowing cash to buyback shares.  They have a significant amount of control over the marketing and distribution of their own product.  Also, there was an &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97149&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1016540&amp;highlight="&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; today of upgraded products, which gives me encouragement that R&amp;amp;D efforts are starting to pay off.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3021465408883473742/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3021465408883473742' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3021465408883473742'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3021465408883473742'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/why-i-sold-call-option-on-select.html' title='Why I sold a call option on Select Comfort'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/566511349_cc40da21ee_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3866362230423086459</id><published>2007-06-18T13:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-18T15:35:34.934-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='KGHI'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Kaiser Group Holdings (and wish I hadn't)</title><content type='html'>On May 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, I bought 19 shares of Kaiser Group Holdings because of this &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/856200/000110465907034303/0001104659-07-034303-index.htm"&gt;preliminary proxy&lt;/a&gt;.  I paid $26.50 a share in hopes getting cashed out at $36 a share.  As of &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/856200/000110465907048046/0001104659-07-048046-index.htm"&gt;this 8-K&lt;/a&gt;, I will be forced to sell for much less than that.  Today's closing price was $26.85, so I don't foresee making a profit on this position.  I broke my rule of waiting for a definitive proxy, so I only have myself to blame.
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://marketprognosticator.blogspot.com/search/label/KGHI.PK"&gt;Eric J. Fox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://iamamazing.wordpress.com/2007/05/30/going-private-arbitrage-kaiser-group-holdings-inc-kghi/"&gt;Eric Schleien&lt;/a&gt;, Kaiser Group is trading below NCAV.  I get a liquidation value of about $33 a share, much of it in cash.  Unfortunately, it's hard to know what management intends to do with that cash.  Going private seemed like a reasonable choice for all the usual reasons&amp;mdash;especially since there's no real operating business here.  Since the company was unable to get the deal done over the last few years, it's hard to believe shareholders will get relief anytime soon.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3866362230423086459/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3866362230423086459' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3866362230423086459'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3866362230423086459'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/why-i-bought-kaiser-group-holdings-and.html' title='Why I bought Kaiser Group Holdings (and wish I hadn&apos;t)'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2741037135990726141</id><published>2007-06-15T14:22:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-14T14:48:05.842-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Select Comfort's problems deepen</title><content type='html'>According to their &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827187/000082718707000026/exhibit99_1.htm"&gt;second quarter update&lt;/a&gt;, Select Comfort management is questioning the new marketing strategy.  Rather than revive sales, as I anticipated, the company expects sales to decline 5% from a year ago.  If that happens, Select Comfort will need to find ways to cut expenses to avoid reporting an EPS loss this quarter.  For the year, management is projecting 87¢ to 93¢ a share compared to 85¢ in 2006.  They have also lowered sales projections to be 4% to 7% growth over last year, which seems optimistic given the very slow start to the year.
&lt;p&gt;
On the flip side, the release also suggested management has found expenses to cut, plans to release upgraded products, and is committed to buying back significant numbers of shares.  Also, the Motley Fool &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/06/14/disquieting-news-from-select-comfort.aspx"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, it is encouraging that management is taking responsibility for the problem.  I had missed this &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/839e752c-15cb-11dc-a7ce-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html"&gt;Financial Times article&lt;/a&gt; from a few days ago that suggested management is weighing acquisition of businesses that would expand Select Comfort internationally or into bedding accessories.  My guess is that these plans are on hold for now, but those are obvious paths to growth in the future.
&lt;p&gt;
If Select Comfort doesn't cut Sales and Marketing costs, which would be difficult given their focus on fixing marketing, I'm guessing they will lose 15¢ this quarter and only earn 55¢ this year.  I'd consider this to be a fairly conservative estimate.    Management's low end 87¢ a share might be more realistic given their insight into the problems, but it's hard to give them much more benefit of the doubt.  Given the various growth opportunities and that we are likely at a trough in sales, 15% growth over the next ten years is not unreasonable.  Beyond that, I'll assume no more than 3% (or slightly more than inflation) growth in the terminal value.  I always use a discount rate of 11%, which is the long-term average of the S&amp;amp;P 500.
&lt;p&gt;
Given those assumptions, my DCF model results in fair value between $15.67 and $24.58:
&lt;pre&gt;
EPS                 0.87    0.55
Historical Growth   2.50% -34.65%
5-year Growth      17.73%   9.11%
  
Growth             15.00%  15.00%
1                  $1.00   $0.64
2                  $1.15   $0.73
3                  $1.32   $0.84
4                  $1.52   $0.97
5                  $1.75   $1.12
6                  $2.01   $1.28
7                  $2.31   $1.48
8                  $2.66   $1.70
9                  $3.06   $1.95
10                 $3.52   $2.24
  
Discount rate      11.00%  11.00%
NPV growth        $10.62   $6.77
  
Stable growth       3.00%   3.00%
NPV terminal      $13.96   $8.90
  
Total             $24.58  $15.67
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort traded up to $17.13 at the close, so the market is definitely leaning toward the lower estimate.  (Not that I think any market participant uses anything like my estimates.  More likely, investors are using management's EPS estimates and knocking the growth rate down a notch or two.)  Back in &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-bought-more-select-comfort-on.html"&gt;December&lt;/a&gt;, I predicted this scenario as a possibility when I bought more shares at $18.  Obviously, I'd prefer results were better&amp;mdash;especially given the change in advertising.  Due to this news, I'm going to try selling a covered call at $17.50, which would be a 4% loss on my recent purchase if exercised.  I still like the long-term prospects of the company, but I like the prospects of First Marblehead even more.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2741037135990726141/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2741037135990726141' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2741037135990726141'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2741037135990726141'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/06/select-comforts-problems-deepen.html' title='Select Comfort&apos;s problems deepen'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-718666070392593306</id><published>2007-06-06T15:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-06T17:28:29.001-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>First Marblehead raises dividend and buys shares</title><content type='html'>First Marblehead just &lt;a href="http://new.marketwire.com/2.0/release.do?id=739749"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a substantial increase in dividend to a yield of about 2.6%.

Essentially, Canon has created a more efficient customer base than its competitors.  It isn't completely clear how they were able to do this, but I have a few theories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canon does not have a personal computer business like HP does.  Some of the printers bundled with PC systems will be heavily used, but consumers who purchase unbundled printers seem more likely to use them.  Brother, Lexmark, and Epson printers also tend to get bundled with PCs.
&lt;li&gt;Canon does bundle photo printers with digital cameras.  Consumers may not be any more likely to be heavy users of these printers, but if they do, they will likely be using more costly color ink and photo paper.
&lt;li&gt;Canon has a long history of supplying HP with the print engine for the LaserJet series of printers.  This arrangement would artificially increase HP's market share number and decrease Canon's, and therefor alter each measure of efficiency.  On the other hand, if Canon sells to HP with a greater profit margin than HP sells to the consumer, which seems likely, the aberration isn't that big a deal.
&lt;li&gt;In the past, color printers used one cartridge to hold all three ink shades, so when you ran out of cyan (probably because you printed too many Word documents with random phrases underlined as if they were email addresses or web links), you had to throw out half a tank of yellow and red.  Canon was fairly early in switching to separate cartridges for each color tank, which intuitively would make one think they sell less ink.  But I suspect the opposite occurred.  Rather than feeling ripped off by a printer company, Canon users felt free to print Word documents with lots of cyan because they knew they wouldn't be wasting a bunch of red and yellow ink.
&lt;li&gt;I don't have any hard and fast evidence, but I feel like Canon printers are easier to use&amp;mdash;especially if you want to print directly from a camera or memory card.  It would be easy to assume that usability is most important as an initial selling point, and that customers are locked in, but that ignores how easy it is to get a new printer at a low cost.
&lt;li&gt;Brand loyalty thanks to years of producing professional and "prosumer" cameras might encourage consumers to buy genuine Canon consumables rather than generics.  I know for my family, we gladly pay more for Canon supplies on the assumption that they will produce better results.

But in the last few years, Canon has raised its dividend to a point where the company can be valued on actual payments to shareholders rather than cash flows which might never reach investors.  Here is a chart of dividend information for the last 10 years:
&lt;pre&gt;
                2007    2006    2005    2004   2003   2002   2001   2000   1999   1998   1997  
Dividend        ¥150.00 ¥125.00 ¥100.00 ¥65.00 ¥50.00 ¥30.00 ¥25.00 ¥21.00 ¥17.00 ¥17.00 ¥17.00
Dividend growth 20.00%  25.00%  53.85%  30.00% 66.67% 20.00% 19.05% 23.53% 0.00%  0.00%  -
Expected growth 11.00%  11.75%  12.28%  13.14% 13.25% 10.49% 10.11% 9.18%  4.61%  8.13%  9.47%
DDM for 5 years ¥7,867  ¥6,813  ¥5,597  ¥3,800 ¥2,939 ¥1,533 ¥1,253 ¥1,003 ¥638   ¥769   ¥824
Price           ¥7,131  ¥7,050  ¥6,710  ¥5,560 ¥5,090 ¥4,580 ¥4,660 ¥4,250 ¥4,160 ¥2,320 ¥3,040
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Expected growth" is the mathematical maximum growth that can be sustained based on a Canon's financial information.  It is composed of retained earnings rate multiplied by return on equity.  Only earnings that are retained (about 75% of income) may be reinvested to fund future dividend growth and the return on equity over the next five years is likely to be about the same as it is this year (15% or so).  Multiply those rates and you get a growth rate of about 11% a year.  Notice that actual dividend growth has been somewhat better than that since 1999 in order to make up for some flat years in the late 1990s.
&lt;p&gt;
I discount that growth at 5% for the next 5 years.  This rate seems appropriate for the low return on Japanese risk-free investment.  At the end of 5 years, I assume Canon's dividend will grow at 2% compared to a discount rate of 5%.  As you can see above, 2007 will be the first year in which the Dividend Discount Model values Canon higher than its market price.  Since the dividend-only model is as conservative as you get in valuation, there's no particular reason to construct a more elaborate model when the value exceeds the current price.  Converted to dollars, the DDM values Canon at about $64.  Meanwhile, the Quicken model I've used in the past puts the value at $77.  The current price is $58.59, so by either measure, Canon is still a good buy after doubling over the last 5 years.
&lt;p&gt;
Since this estimate is based on what Canon is already doing, I see at least two free options offered by the stock.  First, SED TVs could add substantially to Canon's bottom line.  Second, consumers in emerging markets such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, and Mexico may soon afford lower-end digital cameras and printers to replace traditional film cameras.  Canon has pretty much eliminated the PC as a necessary part of the digital imagery work-flow and the upfront costs are within an order of magnitude of film costs.  Over the long-term, digital pictures are vastly cheaper to process and far more convenient for most consumers than film, so I expect the switch-over will happen over the next five years or so.  Kodak and Fujifilm sell billions of dollars of film equipment and services around the world and Canon has a shot at nearly all of that business now.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3859298490645495385/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3859298490645495385' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3859298490645495385'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3859298490645495385'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/05/canons-dividend-valuation.html' title='Canon&apos;s dividend valuation'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2956493582578311610</id><published>2007-05-18T15:12:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-23T14:07:01.739-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Cascading decisions</title><content type='html'>Last week I reinvested another Alberto-Culver dividend and it reminded me that the results of one decision have a powerful effect on subsequent decisions.  My initial thesis in investing in Alberto-Culver turned out to be spectacularly vindicated within a few weeks of the split.  Even if I'd held onto all the pieces, I'd have earned 16% in less than a year.  Obviously, the $25 special dividend has been long spent and I sold most of my Alberto-Culver shares earlier this year.  If I had simply kept the cash, I'd still be up 14% or so.  Instead, I used the cash to purchase more shares of Select Comfort, First Marblehead and a going-private transaction to be named later, which are currently my worst investments.  As a result, I've only gained about 6% on my purchase on the spin-off.
&lt;p&gt;
Now there are a few reasons to ignore this line of reasoning.  For one thing, I still think all three of the new investments are better than Alberto-Culver will be.  The market doesn't agree with me yet, but I'm sure it will eventually.  More importantly, the only good way to judge an investment decision is in isolation of what came before or will come after.  It can be fun to tell a story about how one thing led to another, but the sequence gets tangled very quickly.

Near the end of Lecture 10, Professor Damodaran suggests an interesting adjustment to "punish" companies for having complex structures that are hard to understand and analyze.  The argument goes the more complex a company is, the more places it can hide information about itself and the more likely some of those details will turn out to be bad news.  The professor suggests counting the number of pages in a companies 10-K as a simple way to measure complexity.
&lt;p&gt;
I sort of assume my companies are more transparent than their peers, but I didn't have any way of measuring that.  Now I do.  Here are my core holdings with the first competitor I thought of for reference:
&lt;pre&gt;
Company        Pages
-------        -----
Oracle         103
Canon (20-F)   122
Select Comfort  72
Berkshire       84
Alberto         99   
Sally           99
Marblehead      71+38F

SAP (20-F)     121+70F+1S
HP             152
Tempur-Pedic    48+30F
Citigroup      180
P&amp;G             23
Regis          117
Sallie Mae     118+84F+12A
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know how to treat the extra pages (F-38, A-12 and so on), but my sense is that these are a sign of even more complexity than regular pages.  Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble walk away with the prize in this group, but overall, the companies I own are objectively less complicated than the ones I don't.  I had actually picked Citigroup as a foil to Berkshire because I expected it to have &lt;a href="http://www.performancetrading.it/Documents/AdInformation/AdI_Measuring.htm"&gt;over a thousand pages&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps that number includes all the supplementary documents that I don't plan on even opening.  I only included the main 10-K.
&lt;p&gt;
One other reason to use this sort of test is that if a company's filings are too long or complicated, chances are you won't read it.  My Alberto-Culver investment relied on that principle, since I hoped as few people as possible would have worked though the sum-of-the-parts valuation and I could buy in at a low price.  Now that I've bought, I hope the Sally reports at least are going to become more clear and simple so that other investors can begin to appreciate the company's true worth.  And since insiders have had these same goals, I'm pretty sure my wish will be granted.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/797016782872666832/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=797016782872666832' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/797016782872666832'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/797016782872666832'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/05/cost-of-complexity.html' title='Cost of complexity'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6482576927604385067</id><published>2007-05-10T16:02:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-16T02:54:20.058-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>First Quarter results</title><content type='html'>All of my companies have reported earnings for the first quarter of 2007 (though some of them call it Q2 or Q3).

&lt;p&gt;
One quarter isn't really enough to give a clear picture of a company.  But with the exception of Select Comfort and Sally Beauty, these companies are performing well on a multi-year basis.  I've talked about Select Comfort's issues, so I won't go into them too much more.  This Sunday, they ran a clever ad in Parade magazine that gets delivered with many paper in the US, which confirms my basically good opinion of the new campaign.
&lt;p&gt;
Sally Beauty is a more interesting story.  Remember that I bought it before the split with Alberto-Culver.  After the split, I owned one share of Sally, one share of New Alberto, and $25 for each share of Old Alberto.  The $25 special dividend was paid for by borrowing huge amounts&amp;mdash;in essence prepaying future earnings of Sally.  I haven't seen the latest cash flow statement or balance sheet, but you can get a pretty good idea of the effect of the transaction from this portion of the income statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
3 months ending March 30     2007    2006
                             ----    ---- 
Operating earnings         60,771  51,313
Interest expense           44,947     321
Interest income               300     300
Market interest rate swaps  1,700       -
Net interest expense       42,947      21
   
Earnings before taxes      17,824  51,292
Provision for income taxes  6,785  20,117

Net earnings               11,039  31,175
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Operating earnings are up because of growth in the business and cost savings from no longer being part of Alberto-Culver.  Interest expenses are up dramatically even after income from interest rate swaps because of the massive debt load.  Sally shareholders owe roughly $12.45 a share to Sally bondholders after the special dividend.  Fortunately, there is plenty of cash flow to cover the payments and plenty of growth to grow out from under the debt.  You'd be forgiven for thinking the whole thing is a pointless exercise if I hadn't included the impact of taxes.  Since interest payments are tax-deductible to Sally, net earnings are not as small as you might imagine.  Over the life of the debt, this will amount to significant tax savings.
&lt;p&gt;
Although the market value of my companies have increased at a healthy rate, I'm not currently interested in selling any of them because I believe their potential has increased even more.  That's the reward for buying good companies at a cheap price.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update May 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sally released the balance sheet with their 10-Q and the debt is closer to $10 a share.  Book value is about -$5 a share, which makes life a bit tough from a relative valuation perspective.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6482576927604385067/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6482576927604385067' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6482576927604385067'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6482576927604385067'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/05/first-quarter-results.html' title='First Quarter results'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4494082936801400922</id><published>2007-05-03T10:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-10T16:02:48.391-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Oracle's Edge</title><content type='html'>All companies must deal with a simple truth about the world—things change.  For instance, 150 years ago railroads began to replace horses and ships as the dominate form of transportation.  During the decades of investment in rights of way, rails and rolling stock, it must have seemed the safest of bets that rails would be a fixture of American life for generations to come.  But air travel, which is faster, automobiles, which are more flexible, steam ships, which are more efficient, began to replace the railroads for a great many transporting tasks.  And railroad companies failed to adjust  because they had already made a huge investment in rail infrastructure.

At the dawn of the computer age, IBM was the clear leader in database management systems.  These systems were usually closely tied to the underlying hardware, which meant they traded flexibility for performance.  IBM know about the relational model and had actually built a &lt;a href="http://www.mcjones.org/System_R/"&gt;database system&lt;/a&gt; that followed the model, but it was not marketed a.

Thinking about the methods I use to evaluate the opportunities, I started to wonder if they could be applied to other investments.  Certainly the concept of arbitrage can be extended to other realms such as &lt;a href="http://www.sportsarbitrageguide.com/introduction/"&gt;sports betting&lt;/a&gt;.  The key element is that there must be multiple markets for the arbitrageur to exploit.  In the case of a reverse-split, the two markets are the open market where one normally purchases the shares, and the company market where the company buys the shares.  The reason this arbitrage is profitable is that the second market is only available to those who hold a small number of shares.  In mergers and tender offers open to unlimited amounts, the market adjusts almost immediately to the offered price.
&lt;p&gt;
Value investors do something similar when we attempt to profit on discrepancies between the price and the value of a stock.  Of course, the value market is a theoretical one, at least in the short term.  But the purpose of buying an "undervalued" company is the hope that eventually the market will change in such a way to properly value the position.
&lt;p&gt;
Let's take a look at Berkshire Hathaway, the classic value stock.  First, we need an estimate of the payout if a bet on Berkshire is successful.  The &lt;a href="http://www.creativeacademics.com/finance/IV.html"&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Intrisivaluator&lt;/a&gt; is as good a place to start as any.  Currently, the "Cost of Capital" estimate puts BRK.B shares at $4754.  This estimate assumes a healthy growth rate discounted at Berkshire's cost of capital.  For an estimate of the minimum value, we'll use the "Liquidation" scenario of $3114 a share.  Here the assumption is Berkshire sells off all its assets, settles all its debts, and distributes what's left to shareholders.  There are other choices offered by the model, but for the sake of argument, let's assume that these are the payouts for success and failure.
&lt;p&gt;
The market values BRK.B at $3628 as of today's close.  Using the method I described last week, that implies the market thinks there is roughly a 45% chance Berkshire will perform well enough in the future for "B" shares to be worth $4754 today.  By elimination, that means there's a 55% chance Berkshire will stall out and only pay out $3114.  Obviously any rational view of a company's future will be more nuanced and complicated than a simply success/failure trial.  But it does provide a dead-simple method of calculating the odds of a stock investment.  In this case, the market seems to think Berkshire doesn't have much gas left in the tank.
&lt;p&gt;
One issue with thinking this way for ordinary stocks is that there is no finite termination date.  It's as if the coin keeps spinning and never comes down&amp;mdash;or maybe the coin is flipped over and over again as shares are traded.  But that's not a bad thing from a practical standpoint, since the company's value doesn't stop moving either.  Each quarter there is new input into the value calculation, which often makes a good deal look even better.  If you flip back in the Intrinsivaluator to 1981 ("B" shares, if they existed, were valued at $40), the value keeps climbing as you step through the years.  Even in 1995, when Berkshire seemed most overvalued, a long-term investor would probably regret selling.

As I &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-bought-more-select-comfort-on.html"&gt;mentioned in the past&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent advertisements seemed more like they were hawking drugs not beds.  The new ads are much better and get back to the key elements of the original ads: humor and product focused.  True to form, McKinney produced one spot aimed at women and another aimed at men.
&lt;p&gt;
"Bright Eyed", the weaker of the two in my opinion, begins with scenes of women trying to cover up baggy eyes in the morning with the familiar "What the world needs now..." tune in the background.  A voiceover suggests, "The world doesn't need a better way to fake a good night's sleep...  It needs a better way to sleep."  The payoff is a 5-second explanation of the Sleep Number bed followed by the new tag: "You Can Cure Tired."  Since I'm not the target audience, I don't know if my judgment can be relied on, but the makeup and cucumber scenes seem less humorous and more pathetic than I'd like.
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, "Staying Awake" seems to hit just the right notes.  The opening scenes this time represent over-the-top caffeine/energy drink/stimulant attempts to stay awake under the same music.  The voiceover this time says, "The world doesn't need a better way to stay awake...  It needs a better way to sleep."  The spot is a full minute instead of 30-seconds and it uses the time to establish a bit more clearly that the first part is about covering up the real problem: being tired.  It also introduces a protagonist who buys a moderate-sized cup of coffee and rejects the "moster caf 72" coffee mug.  As he walks  down the street, he observes in disbelief the Ka-Blowie stimulant-smoothie stand, Wakey'z Drugmall, a dog lapping up coffee abandoned by a napping newspaper seller, and so on.  Finally, the man notices a helpful Select Comfort salesman waving to him from in front of his store.  The ad ends with the same explanation and tagline.
&lt;p&gt;
"Cure Tired" is a pretty good tag, especially since the beds actually work.  Every time I'm forced to sleep in some other bed, even a relatively comfortable bed, I'm quite happy to go home and rest in a bed that adjusts to fit me.
&lt;p&gt;
SCSS has just released their first quarter earnings which were fairly well described on the &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/04/26/select-comfort-doesnt-let-the-bedbugs-bite-fool-by.aspx"&gt;Fool&lt;/a&gt;.    Obviously I'd prefer if comparable sales were better and it makes me nervous to have management back-load earnings so much.  But I think there is a good chance advertising will make a difference.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/2035109347971131609/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=2035109347971131609' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2035109347971131609'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/2035109347971131609'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/select-comforts-new-ad-direction.html' title='Select Comfort&apos;s new ad direction'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8144116999404830615</id><published>2007-04-24T15:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-25T17:07:43.375-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>How I added to Canon's results</title><content type='html'>There's a pretty good &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2007/04/24/canons-stunning-picture.aspx"&gt;summary of Canon's Q1&lt;/a&gt; at the Motley Fool.  As it happens, I feel partially responsible.  You see, earlier this year I bought my wife a &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/digital/data/2005_eos-kiss_dn.html"&gt;Canon Rebel XT&lt;/a&gt; .  It was intended to replace the &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/digital/data/2004_ps-a85.html"&gt;A85&lt;/a&gt; I bought her a few years ago and the &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/1997-/data/1999_eos-kiss3.html"&gt;Rebel 2000&lt;/a&gt; I gave her a few years before.  For at least this consumer, Canon has been able to sell higher margin products as the years go by.
&lt;p&gt;
The financial statements support this.  In 1999, the year the Rebel 2000 was first introduced in Japan, Canon converted ¥3 of every ¥100 in sales to profit.  In 2006, it converted ¥11.  There are lots of reasons for this, such as the move from film to digital, point &amp;amp; shoot to SLRs, black and white to color copiers and printers, currency benefits, and operating efficiencies.  Meanwhile, Canon has taken a hit in asset turnover, which has fallen from ¥98 to ¥92 of revenue per ¥100 of assets.  This is to be expected since higher margins usually imply lower sales.  Fortunately, the overall effect has been positive as measured by ROA, which went from 2.71% to 10.07%.
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, Canon has been de-leveraging over that same time-frame.  Its equity to asset ratio dropped from 2.15 to 1.51 thanks to decreases in long-term debt and capital leases.  Normally this has a negative effect on return on equity, but because of Canon's stellar margins, ROE has improved from 5.84% to 15.25%.  Mathematically, it doesn't much matter which of the ROE component ratios improve, but financially its nice to "front-load" the ratios.  In general, it is easier to improve asset turnover through discounting or leverage through borrowing than it is to increase margins.  This is especially true in a highly competitive business like digital cameras and printers. 
&lt;p&gt;
I don't imagine margins will improve much from here on out, but there is hope for further growth in new products.  Currently the company is working on launching SED TVs and have announced a medical device initiative.  I'm a bit worried about the plan to develop (and I'm not making this up) &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/ir/housin2007/p17.html"&gt;intelligent robots&lt;/a&gt;.  Whatever that means.  I'm confident that Canon's R&amp;amp;D investments will pay off over time, but it's nice to have such strong operations while we wait.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8144116999404830615/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8144116999404830615' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8144116999404830615'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8144116999404830615'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/how-i-added-to-canons-results.html' title='How I added to Canon&apos;s results'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-965179931438250315</id><published>2007-04-24T12:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-24T15:43:18.429-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RGS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='WFMI'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><title type='text'>The business of beauty</title><content type='html'>It's been a while since I wrote about Sally Beauty, but there were two stories that I thought were worth reading.  First is a story from Forbes on &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/04/20/whole-foods-revlon-ent-manage-cx_bn_0420fundsalonintro.html"&gt;starting a salon business&lt;/a&gt;.  Sally got a mention as a supplier of salons, but what was more interesting to me was the advice to adopt a Whole Foods approach to employees.  "In the salon world, the most precious resources are stylists, so keeping them around and happy is critical."  The article suggested emulating Whole Foods' training program.
&lt;p&gt;
On a related note, Regis is &lt;a href="http://footnoted.org/beauty-school-dropout/"&gt;dropping out of the beauty school business&lt;/a&gt; by merging most of its schools with Empire Education Group.  The &lt;a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/education/20070419/CLTH06819042007-1.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; has more information including the suggestion that the need for IT investment was the reason for the merger.  As you might recall, Regis was initially interested in buying Sally Beauty, but was rejected at the last moment because of operating weakness.
&lt;p&gt;
It seems to me that while the beauty salon industry as a whole resists consolidation, the supporting industries are successfully consolidating.  Beauty schools and salon product distributors benefit from economies of scale, but salons themselves rely to a large extent on the services of talented stylists.  Since talented stylists know they are an important part of the success of a salon, they demand a larger slice of the profits.  There are dozens of professions with this dynamic including chefs, athletes, programmers, artists of all types, and so on.  But unlike other professions, it's difficult for individual stylists to scale their work&amp;mdash;they can only cut one head of hair at a time.

To show how it works, let's take my first going-private transaction, Major Automotive.  On October 14, 2005, the company announced plans to implement a reverse split that would pay $1.90 to shareholders of less then 1000 shares.  On March 29, 2006, I bought 999 shares at $1.75 a share.  After the $19.95 commission charged by my broker at the time, I hoped to make $129.90 when the reverse split was resolved.  I guess that there was at least a 95% chance the split would succeed from that point since insiders owned 49.4% of the company.  I don't like the idea of assigning higher odds because of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law"&gt;Murphy's Law&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
If the split failed to happen, what would my position have been worth?  The most pessimistic choice would be to assign no value.  It isn't unreasonable either, since I'd done basically zero research into the underlying value of the company.  In that case, I'd have lost the entire $1,768.20 that the position had cost.  The expected payout would be $129.90*0.95 + (0-$1,768.20)*(1-0.95) = $34.995, which isn't half bad for a zero-research investment.  A slightly more realistic value would be the price of the shares just before the reverse split was announced.  On October 13, 2005, Major Automotive was priced at $1.40 a share.  Using that price as a floor, the expected payout was $103.93.  If you are following along don't forget to include an extra commission as an added cost of failure.
&lt;p&gt;
As it turns out, you can calculate the odds the market is assigning to an arbitrage situation with a little bit of math.  This is the equation for expected payout:
&lt;pre&gt;
S*p + F*(1-p) = E

where:
S = price if split succeeds
F = price if split fails
p = split probablity
E = expected price
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the market is rational, you'd expect the market price to match the expected price.  I used the &lt;a href="http://www.mathomatic.org"&gt;Mathomatic&lt;/a&gt; Computer Algebra System to solve for p:

#1: (S*p) + (F*(1 - p)) = E

1-&gt; solve p

        (E - F)
#1: p = -------
        (S - F)

&lt;/pre&gt;
Now if you plug in the values for Major Automotive when I bought it, you get a 70% probability that the split would happen.
&lt;p&gt;
Since my probability estimate (95%) was much greater than the market's, my expected payout was correspondingly higher.  Given enough of these situations profits would be astronomical for anyone who could identify them.  According to the Kelly Criterion, the optimum allocation for even the pessimistic case is 27%.  (This can be calculated by taking the expected payout and dividing by the maximum payout or $34.99/$129.90.  The more optimistic case calls for a whopping 80% allocation.)  Unfortunately, these situations are rare.  The only reason reverse splits are so wildly mis-priced is that arbitrage positions are limited to a small number of shares.  Unless you have a portfolio of only a few thousand dollars, it's impossible to allocate the optimal amount even under the pessimistic case.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/5887968415790165568/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=5887968415790165568' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5887968415790165568'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5887968415790165568'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/arbitrage-odds.html' title='Arbitrage odds'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6700646265683883865</id><published>2007-04-19T17:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-19T17:35:36.431-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Letter to my Congressman</title><content type='html'>Congressman Schiff,

I've been living, working and going to church in the 29th District for several years now.  I think it's an ideal to be and I'd love to stay here for years to come.  My wife and I have been watching the housing market in Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank and wondering if there is any home we could afford and imagine living in for years if not decades.  But so far we haven't found anyway that it would make sense to stop renting and start owning.

We aren't the only people who are having this problem either.  Over the last few years we've known many people who have left the area primarily because they haven't been able to afford the cost of housing in the District.  We also know families who have bought here, but are now struggling under burdensome debt.  Clearly this situation can't last forever and there are signs that housing costs are finally starting to come down again.

I'm writing to you today because lately I've seen suggestions from some of your colleagues in Congress that the Federal Government should step in to ease the pain created by the high cost of housing around the country.  I think is a really bad idea at this point.  

Thank you,
Jon Ericson</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6700646265683883865'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6700646265683883865'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3106611313033371569</id><published>2007-04-16T13:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-18T13:28:09.224-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>First Marblehead gets cheaper and I couldn't be happier</title><content type='html'>First Marblehead has lost 23.67% since I bought it in March (-98.36% annualized).  Obviously, I would be happier if I had waited to buy, but getting cheaper is a good thing overall.  Consider the &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/four-factors-of-value-creation.html"&gt;Four Factors&lt;/a&gt;.  The only one that has really changed since I bought is equity valuation, which has improved to 24¢ of equity per dollar of price.  Other investors might have lowered their estimates of asset value and future earnings based on &lt;a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/barrons/index.cfm?story=20070403"&gt;potential defaults&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/first-marblehead-off-25-concern/story.aspx?guid=%7B7C771886%2D4E44%2D41E1%2D9DA8%2DF9F759EBA5C6%7D&amp;siteid=yhoo&amp;dist=yhoo"&gt;potential acquisition of Sallie Mae&lt;/a&gt;.  But I don't think those fears are warranted and I haven't changed my estimates.
&lt;p&gt;
Having already bought shares, how can the lower price help me?  For one thing, I could buy more shares (&lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/03/19/when-to-double-down.aspx"&gt;double down&lt;/a&gt;).  But as I'm short of investable cash, that isn't an option.  If the price doesn't recover before First Marblehead distributes its next dividend, I'll be able to &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/buying-alberto-culver-and-trying-to.html"&gt;reinvest&lt;/a&gt; it at a lower cost.  A more likely scenario is that First Marblehead will repurchase on the open market over the next few days.
&lt;p&gt;
There are potential disadvantages to a lower prices.  For instance, if I needed to sell today, I would realize a substantial loss.  Or a third party might attempt to takeover First Marblehead.  Or if First Marblehead were to issue shares (perhaps as a part of executive compensation), it will get less value per share than it would have a few months ago.  But as long as those things don't occur, lower prices can only be good for shareholders.
&lt;p&gt;
As for the "news" that has been driving down FMD's price, I'm not too worried.  The default scare seems &lt;a href="http://www.bankstocks.com/article.asp?type=1&amp;id=9881345"&gt;totally bogus&lt;/a&gt;.  First Marblehead's estimate of residual value seems very solid.
&lt;p&gt;
The issue with the SLM buyout seems to be that two potential purchasers, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, are also two of First Marblehead's clients and might direct private student loan business to Sallie Mae.  FMD's CEO has said that there will be &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN1631428020070416"&gt;no impact on his company&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't see how there could be an immediate impact since neither company would control SLM.  Two private equity investment companies, J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. and Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe LLC, hold majority stakes and I doubt they would be willing to give away Sallie Mae's competitive advantages to the giant banks.  A scenario that seems more probably is that the banks will outsource their student loans to SLM over time.  But they could have done that even before this buyout was proposed, so I don't see what the big deal is.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3106611313033371569/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3106611313033371569' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3106611313033371569'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3106611313033371569'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/04/first-marblehead-gets-cheaper-and-i.html' title='First Marblehead gets cheaper and I couldn&apos;t be happier'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3204402145374541405</id><published>2007-04-11T12:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-11T12:48:02.065-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Naked shorts</title><content type='html'>I think it would help you argument if you had an example or two of companies that failed because of naked shorts.

You'd want to pass over companies that failed for other reasons such as accounting fraud, over-leveraging, selling stuff no one wants, consistently losing money, etc.  In those cases, it's hard not to argue that naked short selling is a public service since it might hasten the demise of these companies and limit the number of times they can dip into the equity markets to raise capital.

I suspect that short selling is only one factor in bringing down these companies.  The better argument against naked short selling is that it isn't available to the average investor, so market makers can gain an unfair advantage.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3204402145374541405'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3204402145374541405'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-8568680861703061762</id><published>2007-04-03T13:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-04-18T13:29:27.232-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='FMD'/><title type='text'>Four Factors of value creation</title><content type='html'>Dean Oliver (the Bill James of basketball), describes the &lt;a href="http://www.rawbw.com/%7Edeano/articles/20040601_roboscout.htm"&gt;Four Factors of Basketball Success&lt;/a&gt;.  They are shooting, taking care of the ball, offensive rebounding, and getting to to foul line.  There are hundreds of other statistics that are of interest, but unless they measure aspects of these factors, they aren't all that important to actual basketball success.  Think of the Four Factors as a framework for interpretation.
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that there are Four Factors for value creation as well.  Obviously there are even more statistics that may be important to understanding a company, but these four represent a complete path from customer to shareholder.  I'm going to use my new favorite investment, First Marblehead, to illustrate the concepts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most public companies derive their value from sales.  (The exception are companies like biotechnology firms that hope to turn ideas or other assets into sales at a later date.)  But not all sales are created equal.  Companies need to charge more than the goods and services cost to produce.  And there are other costs such as overhead and taxes that need to be considered.  From a shareholders perspective, those costs add little to the value of the company.  So the first factor is &lt;strong&gt;Net Profit Margin&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Earnings 
-------- = Net Profit Margin
Sales   
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In it's most recent 10-K, from June 2006, First Marblehead reported revenue of $563.572 million and, after subtracting costs, earnings of $235.960 million.  Divide earnings by sales and the profit margin works out to 41.87%.  In other words, 42¢ of each dollar in sales is profit to First Marblehead owners.  Compared to the &lt;a href="http://www.investor.reuters.wallst.com/stocks/Ratios.asp?ticker=FMD"&gt;Consumer Financial Services industry&lt;/a&gt; average of 13.77%&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, FMD must be doing something right.
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically, what companies with high profit margins have done is a combination of raising prices and lowering costs.  The risk is that customers don't like higher prices and that lower costs might mean lower quality products, which also don't go over well with customers.  So if you've got two companies and one has a higher profit margin than the other, you would also expect it to have lower sales.  But just as we compared earnings to sales, we need to compare sales to something else.  If one company has two stores, you'd expect it to sell twice as much as a company with just one store.  A company that sells to customers all over the world probably has more sales than a similar company that just operates in one city.  So you have to compare sales to the company's size or potential.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Asset Turnover&lt;/strong&gt; is the second factor:
&lt;pre&gt;
Sales
------ = Asset Turnover
Assets
&lt;/pre&gt;
Every company has assets such as offices, factories, stores, patent portfolios, and so on, which it can use to generate sales.  First Marblehead had $770.346 million worth of assets as of June, 2006.  The bulk of those assets are residuals in its  securitization trusts, which have the potential to contribute to future income as the underlying loans are paid off.  For fiscal 2006, every dollar of assets produced 73¢ of sales.  Since the industry average is about 21¢, First Marblehead looks even better.
&lt;p&gt;
How much better?  Well if you multiply the first two factors, you get another ratio called &lt;strong&gt;Return on Assets&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Earnings   Sales
-------- X ------ = Return on Assets
Sales      Assets
&lt;/pre&gt;
This number measures how well management has balanced price, costs, quality and demand.  Higher prices tend to depress demand, and lower costs tend to lower quality which lowers demand.  But First Marblehead seems to be able to defy those tendencies since it has a ROA of 30.63% compared to the industry at 2.91%.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  Given the first two factors, you might wonder how other financial service companies could compete with First Marblehead.  There are several answers including some peculiarities in the way GAAP requires it to report earnings that affect the ratios.  But the biggest difference is the third factor, which is &lt;strong&gt;Leverage&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Assets
------ = Leverage
Equity
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Companies, especially financial companies, use debt an other liabilities to buy more assets that can in turn be used to generate sales.  If you have one store and you've maximized its ROA, you can borrow money to open a second store.  The result on the balance sheet is that you've increased you assets, but your equity has stayed the same.  One the second store is operating as efficiently as the first, you will be generating twice as many sales and twice the earnings as well.  As an equity investor, I don't really care how much debt a company takes on as long as there is a reasonable chance the company can pay it off with out hurting earnings.
&lt;p&gt;
First Marblehead's leverage is 1.34, which is wimpy compared to the industry average of 7.54.   &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=SLM"&gt;Sally Mae&lt;/a&gt;, a competitor, is leveraged at $26.6 of assets for each dollar of equity.  This is serious leverage which can lead to serious returns.  At this point, there is a possibility FMD is leaving money on the table by not taking on debt to increase leverage.  In order to decide, we can calculate &lt;strong&gt;Return on Equity&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Earnings   Sales    Assets
-------- X ------ X ------ = Return on Equity
Sales      Assets   Equity
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First Marblehead's ROE is 40.95% compared to 22.01% for its industry.  Imagine a rich uncle offered to give you a fixed amount of equity in any company in the world.  You pick the company and your uncle will give you enough shares so that the equity you own equals the fixed amount.  It's obvious that you'd look for a company that has the best ROE and seems likely to continue to do well in the future.   If you were limited to student loan companies First Marblehead looks a lot better than &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=uncl&amp;hl=en"&gt;My Rich Uncle&lt;/a&gt; which has a ROE of -253.53%&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  If this were the way you acquired shares, we could stop the analysis right here.  But normally you have to buy them on the stock market.  The final factor doesn't have a standard name, but I'm going to call it &lt;strong&gt;Equity Valuation&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Equity
------ = Equity Valuation
Price
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In theory, if a company closed shop, sold off all its assets, paid off all its creditors, and distributed the proceeds to investors, shareholder equity would be the value of the company.  But some assets (such as newly purchased manufacturing equipment) are overvalued on the books and other assets (such as goodwill from profitable acquisitions) are undervalued.  Further, some assets like brand names don't show up on the books at all.  So Equity Valuation is rarely equal to one.  For First Marblehead on June 30, 2006 the market paid one dollar for just 16¢ of shareholder equity.  The industry average is 28¢, so the market rightly considers First Marblehead to be a better than average company.
&lt;p&gt;
When you put together all of the factors, you get a familiar measure:
&lt;pre&gt;
Earnings   Sales    Assets   Equity
-------- X ------ X ------ X ------ = Earnings Yield
Sales      Assets   Equity   Price
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Earnings Yield&lt;/strong&gt; is P/E ratio inverted.  First Marblehead's earnings yield was 6.46% compared to 6.88% for the industry.  Now you might argue the relative quality of FMD to industry earnings or the relative growth rates or relative risks that make the final numbers better or worse than they appear, but that's missing the point.  When I really need to find a companies value, I'm better off running a discount cash flow model.  This exercise is more about the way earning yields can be composed and what companies can do to increase their value.
&lt;p&gt;

Footnotes:
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reuters uses a different method to calculate these ratios, so we have to take these numbers with a grain of salt.
  &lt;li&gt;Remember, other methods of calculation give different results.  The important thing to understand is what the ratios mean and to try to be consistent.  In this case, the 5-year average assets that Reuters uses overstates First Marblehead's ROA, since it is growing so quickly.
  &lt;li&gt;MRU holdings seems an unbelievably bad investment.  I suppose the thesis is that eventually it will grow its way into profitability.

On the other hand, since their IPO in 2004, FMD has quadrupled its workforce to support massive growth in loan volume.
&lt;p&gt;
No doubt some of these listings are simply replacing people who left for one reason or another.  But reading the descriptions is pretty interesting.  For instance there's a position open for someone to represent First Marblehead to schools in the Pacific Northwest.  Then there are openings for a variety of technical positions including a information security analyst, SA, Oracle DBA, Informatica developer, etc.  Then there are financial positions like "Capital Markets Quantitative Analyst" and "Risk Data Management Associate".  Most intriguing, is a position for a project manager.  I can't be sure, but it seems like First Marblehead is gearing up for some new IT project.

That's exactly how I was feeling last week as I set my limit order on First Marblehead each evening.  Obviously, given a choice, I prefer to pay at the low end of what the market offers each day.  But as the price crept up day after day during the week, I realized that I'd be willing to pay a lot more to get into a position and that my window of opportunity might be closing up.  As the sub-prime lending story peeks, its negative effect on financial companies' shares could subside.
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, the sub-prime meltdown could actually help First Marblehead. In the past, consumers might be tempted to pay for college with a mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW), but that option may be less attractive in the future. Banks in the midst of tightening housing loans, might see education loans as a partial replacement for growth. Bond investors might see education loans (which can't be wiped out by bankruptcy and are backed by third-party guarantees) as a safer alternative investment. It's kinda like how pushing down on one part of a water bed causes another part to be pushed up.
&lt;p&gt;
One item to watch as time goes on is the trend of the "trust updates" lines in the income statement. According to the 10-K: "Trust updates reflect changes resulting from the passage of time, which results in accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates of additional structural advisory fees and residuals, as well as changes in the assumptions, if any, underlying our estimates of the fair value of these service revenue components." In 2002 (the first year I can track down those numbers), the updates represented 1.23% of the total "service receivables" line on the balance sheet, which is First Marblehead's share of the trusts. Since then, the updates have fluctuated between 4.44% and 6.25%. If I understand it correctly, this number represents the sum of all previous years' conservative accounting. If the company gets too aggressive in the coming years or if lots of borrowers prepay their loans, that number could go down or become negative.
&lt;p&gt;
In a sense, First Marblehead's conservative estimation of it's trust assets is akin to other under-valued assets such as real estate carried at cost or Oracle's installed base.  Analysts tend to discount these assets altogether since they can't be precisely valued.  The Standard &amp; Poor's report on First Marblehead says, "Cash generated from operations totaled 21% and 68% of net income in FY 06 and FY 05, respectively.  We believe the relatively low percentage of net income converted into cash stems from the large portion of FMD's revenues that are derived from residuals from securitized loans."  Now these statements are true, but I'm not sure they are the negative that the report implies.  If the company, &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; convert earnings to cash, there's an obvious problem.  But it seems like management has gone out of its way to structure the trusts so that First Marblehead gets the residuals, which makes sense because it doesn't really need cash and nobody else can value them as well as First Marblehead can.  They are &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000012.html"&gt;eating their own dog food&lt;/a&gt;, which must be encouraging to lenders and bond investors.

In order to understand why I believe Wall Street undervalues this company, it's important to understand what a difficult asset private student loans are to value:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Student loans are not backed by an asset that can be repossessed and sold as are mortgages and car loans.
&lt;li&gt;Borrowers often have no income or even credit histories.
&lt;li&gt;Student loans do not normally need to be repaid until after the student graduates and enters the workforce.
&lt;li&gt;Loans do not normally carry a pre-payment penalty.
&lt;li&gt;Loans may take 20 to 25 years to be repaid in full.
&lt;li&gt;Private student loans are not backed by a government guarantee, but must compete (at least indirectly) with state and federal government-backed loans.
&lt;li&gt;There is great variation in the ability and willingness of students to repay their loans upon graduation.
&lt;li&gt;Student loans are highly regulated.
&lt;li&gt;Securitization is required for the original lenders to transfer student loans to investors.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These "borrower-friendly" loans (as First Marblehead's CEO calls them) present many difficulties to lenders who would like to enter the market.  The only way to be comfortable issuing these loans is to gather a few years (at least 10, I'd imagine) of experience and borrower data.  That is exactly what First Marblehead offers.  It's important to understand that the company doesn't originate or guarantee any loans, but provide outsourcing to lenders so that they can establish there own "private label" student loan programs.
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, First Mablehead provides these services at or near cost, and in exchange, the loan originators agree that if they sell the loans, they do it through First Marblehead.  The process of selling loans to investors, called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization"&gt;securitization&lt;/a&gt;, can be complicated and risky, but banks are generally eager to transfer loans to third parties so that the proceeds may be reinvested.  Again, FMD has many years of experience.  Once the loans are sold to investors, the originating banks are generally free of them altogether.
&lt;p&gt;
If you are observant, you'll notice that so far First Marblehead can't make any profit since it provides services to lenders at cost.  When it structures a loan secutization, First Marblehead creates a trust where lenders deposit loans and divides the into tranches with different risks and returns.  If the underlying loans are paid off as scheduled, the junior tranches will earn substantial returns on investment.  If many of the loans go bad or are paid early, the junior tranches may earn less than expected or even lose principle.  Setting up and administering these trusts is a difficult and complicated task, so First Marblehead is able to change substantial fees for these services.
&lt;p&gt;
The bulk of the fees are paid upfront by the trust.  In the most recent securitization, First Marblehead claimed 13% of the trust balance upfront.  It also receives ongoing fees (~1%) and residuals (~5%) of the trust.  The later fees are estimates of the present value over the life of the trust, so if the loans default or get paid early, the result could be much worse.  Residuals are the most junior tranche in the trust, so in theory, First Marblehead takes the greatest risk and earns the greatest return. 
&lt;p&gt;
The beauty of the First Marblehead model is that it requires very little upfront and ongoing capital expenses.  Most of its value to customers arises from its borrower database, the expertise of its employees, and the strong history of its securitizations.  The market for private student loans is growing so quickly, there isn't any need to spend money to expand operations.  In my opinion, this investment is a bit like buying Oracle a the start of the internet revolution.  As the market increases, lenders are going to be more interested in taking advantage of the intellectual property First Marblehead already owns.
&lt;p&gt;
Based on explosive earnings growth, it wouldn't be too surprising to find that First Marblehead is priced to perfection.  But my DCF model suggests that the shares are fairly priced even if earnings remain level for the next ten years.  Part of the problem seems to be that current earnings are somewhat uncertain since a large portion are estimates of future cash flows from residuals and ongoing fees.  The flip-side is that the estimates might under-value these future cash-flows.  So far, the estimates seem to be on the conservative side.
&lt;p&gt;
One concern is the possibility that lenders will decide to hold onto loans rather than securitize them.  If that happens, there's no profit for First Marblehead and the lenders might develop their own borrower databases.  This (and many other) concerns are addressed by &lt;a href="http://www.bankstocks.com/article.asp?id=9881212"&gt;an excellent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from Tom Brown.  (To be honest, I never would have found this company without reading his website.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6607721400757951021/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6607721400757951021' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6607721400757951021'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6607721400757951021'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-i-bought-first-marblehead.html' title='Why I bought First Marblehead'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-4344875028883991646</id><published>2007-03-21T09:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-30T12:40:42.900-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RHT'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='KO'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SAP'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='XOM'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BUD'/><title type='text'>Is organic growth better?</title><content type='html'>One &lt;a href="http://stockmarketbeat.com/blog1/2007/03/21/orcl-oracle-earnings/"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to Oracle's 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Quarter earnings pointed out that we don't really know how much of Oracle's recent growth has been due to acquisitions and how much is organic.  All other things being equal, organic growth is the best sort of growth.  For one thing, acquisitions tend to be more expensive and can mask problems in the acquiring company.
&lt;p&gt;
Suppose, for instance, that Coke noticed problems in its flagship product.  So management decides to acquire Budweiser at a steep premium.  Then they refuse to break out the portion of revenues that was beer related so that investors won't notice the slowdown in Coke sales.  Another issue is that this sort of growth isn't sustainable.  Who would Coke buy next?
&lt;p&gt;
But not all acquisition strategies are created equal.  Right now, Exxon Mobil is raking in huge amounts of cash for delivering gas to American drivers.  But it's clear the ride won't last forever.  Eventually existing reserves will be tapped and new sources of energy will be required.  Although Exxon could use it's current resources to research and develop alternative energy, it might be cheaper and less risky to wait for a smaller company to develop a winning solution and buy that company.
&lt;p&gt;
This, in fact, is Oracle's strategy.  Actually, the database giant does one better&amp;mdash;they supply the platform that upstart companies use to develop new products.  Most modern "Enterprise" applications use some sort of relational database to store vast amounts of information about an enterprise and its connections to the outside world.  Generally, the Oracle database must be at least among the target platforms that applications support.  Therefore, as new companies emerge to write software for specialized purposes, they are likely to target Oracle's database.  And Oracle's R&amp;D efforts to improve the Oracle platform will encourage more startups to target it.
&lt;p&gt;
But small software companies have several problems that a large company, such as Oracle, can solve.  Small companies are required to spend a significant portion of their revenues selling to customers, supporting customers, and providing a productive work environment for employees.  These activities scale particularly well, so larger companies have an edge over smaller ones.  As a result, a new product has the potential to become significantly more profitable as part of the Oracle stack then it does on its own.
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally, Oracle &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; develop new products for new markets.  But it's unreasonable to demand a company grow organically when it has the opportunity to acquire growth for a lower cost and lower risk.
&lt;p&gt;
On a mildly related note, there's news today that Oracle is suing SAP.  &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/sapsuit/complaint.pdf"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; accuses TomorrowNow, a company SAP bought shortly after the PeopleSoft acquisition, used support login information from customers who had or were about to switch away from Oracle support to download documents, patches and software.  It seems there were numerous unnamed SAP employees involved in the project who are included among the defendants.  I can't imagine legal documents normally are very good reads, but Oracle lawyers seem to have a knack for producing entertaining briefs.  I throughly enjoyed the anti-trust briefs from a few years ago as well.
&lt;p&gt;
I am a bit concerned that the lawsuit will backfire in the court of public opinion, since Oracle is attempting a similar support contract end-around against Red Hat.  Assuming Oracle has obtained and is using its support material legally, there won't be an actual lawsuit, but there might be questions within the open source community and the media.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4344875028883991646/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4344875028883991646' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4344875028883991646'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4344875028883991646'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/is-organic-growth-better.html' title='Is organic growth better?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3343610844970429050</id><published>2007-03-19T10:29:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-19T15:29:32.728-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACVCX'/><title type='text'>Why I sold Alberto-Culver</title><content type='html'>A few weeks ago, I &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-i-sold-alberto-culver-call-option.html"&gt;sold a call option&lt;/a&gt; against Alberto-Culver and on Friday, the option was exercised.  I can't think of a better way to sell my shares: I sold for $22.50, the price on Friday was $22.51, and I got paid 30¢ for the privilege.  As a result, my total combined ratio (after taking a penny a share loss) is 25.92%.
&lt;p&gt;
I still have a few shares left, but I got out of the bulk of my position in Alberto, because my &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-bought-alberto-culver.html"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; is no longer valid&amp;mdash;Sally Beauty was spun off.  As it happens, I estimate that I earned 17.47% (38.90% annualized) on the first purchase and 16.32% (46.72% annualized) on the &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-bought-more-alberto-culver.html"&gt;second purchase&lt;/a&gt;.  "New Alberto" did better than I &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/10/alberto-culver-breakup-value.html"&gt;prediced&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm quite pleased with the overall transaction.
&lt;p&gt;
I still think Alberto will outperform the market over the next 5 to 10 years, but I don't think it will be a dramatic overachiever.  I'll maintain a minimal stake in the company for a long time, if only because it isn't cost-effective to sell.  Based on the dividend discount model, I guesstimate the shares are worth closer to $25 apiece, but I'm happy to sell in order to free up cash for an even better opportunity that I hope to buy into within a few weeks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/3343610844970429050/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=3343610844970429050' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3343610844970429050'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/3343610844970429050'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-i-sold-alberto-culver.html' title='Why I sold Alberto-Culver'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-3059354689381267248</id><published>2007-03-16T16:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-16T16:27:44.363-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Now what?</title><content type='html'>Amazingly, Alberto-Culver ended the day at $22.51.

Watching my option come down to the wire is a bit like watching the final possessions of a basketball game.  Early in the game, "fundamental analysis" such as per-possession offense and defense are the best ways to predict the outcome.  By the end of the game, however, nearly everything that has happened to that point in the season is meaningless.  Often games come down to a handful of possessions in the final minutes that determine which team will come out ahead.  In other words, close games are determined by luck.
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, the odds of avoiding a "loss" on the option where roughly the same as a team up by 2 points playing defense with the shot clock turned off.  Today, Alberto-Culver shares jumped 1%, which is sort of like hitting a three pointer.  Tomorrow is the final possession of the game, since the option will expire if not exercised.  If I'm to record a profit on the option, I need Alberto-Culver to drop by 0.22 or more in tomorrow's session.
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7319907@N05/422417231/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/422417231_11668996f7.jpg" width="500" height="339" alt="Odds of -0.22% or greater gain of Alberto-Culver in one day" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Notice that the curve is much smoother around the zero line than the graphs I showed yesterday.  That's because I corrected the issue with excess 0% gains.  (Basically, I use the &lt;a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/finance/quotes/quote-12.html"&gt;adjusted close&lt;/a&gt; from Yahoo to avoid miscalculations due to splits and dividends.  But that sacrifices precision, especially early in a stock's history.  Therefore, if the two adjusted prices are the same and the actual closing prices are only a few percentage points from 0%, I now use the actual closing prices.) 
&lt;p&gt;
Writing call options is a bit like playing a slightly better team.  Over a long period of time, the stock market in general goes up.  This graph is the odds that the S&amp;P 500 will advance in a particular day.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, call options pay a premium, which is a little bit like being spotted a few points (or betting with a point spread).  For the ACV option, the game is coming down to the wire.  I think I made the right decision based on fundamentals, but I still might be on the wrong side of the trade tomorrow.
&lt;p&gt;
The odds the option will be exercised tomorrow are roughly 80%, so by Monday I should have the cash to make another purchase.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/8022397080183041962/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=8022397080183041962' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8022397080183041962'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/8022397080183041962'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/final-possession-on-alberto-culver.html' title='Final possession on Alberto-Culver option'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/422417231_11668996f7_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-630130160171732757</id><published>2007-03-14T15:35:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-14T17:31:34.815-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACVCX'/><title type='text'>Odds of my ACV option getting exercised</title><content type='html'>As of the market close today, Alberto-Culver stands exactly at $22.50&amp;mdash;my option's strike price.  I would expect the option to be exercised if the price ends a penny or two higher on Friday.  This graph shows that (if the past is any guide) there is a better-than-even chance I'll be selling my shares.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7319907@N05/421441761/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/421441761_8c466ebb41.jpg" width="500" height="347" alt=" Odds of 0% or greater gain of ACV over 2 days" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The horizontal axis shows the range of gains and losses experienced by ACV shares over any two day period.  The vertical axis is the odds that the price will increase by a certain percentage or greater in two days.  So for a 0% or greater increase, the odds are 56% or so.  Actually due to rounding errors there are more 0% gains in my data then there ought to be.  (You will notice that the curve becomes vertical on the 0% line.  That's not an optical illusion, but an artifact in the data.)
&lt;p&gt;
If the increase is 0.89% or greater, my option will lose money compared to simply selling the underlying stock on Friday.  This graph shows that the odds are roughly 34% of taking a "loss" on the transaction.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7319907@N05/421440590/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/421440590_63acdb5fa8.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="Odds of 0.89% or greater gain of ACV over 2 days" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally, the shares will end somewhere between $22.50 and $22.70 so that I will sell the shares at a gain (odds ~ 22%).  If that happens, I am ready to roll the proceeds into a new investment.  If the option is not assigned, I might sell outright or (more likely) sell another covered call for April.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/630130160171732757/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=630130160171732757' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/630130160171732757'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/630130160171732757'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/odds-of-my-acv-option-getting-exercised.html' title='Odds of my ACV option getting exercised'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/421441761_8c466ebb41_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-6358969526457552608</id><published>2007-03-09T14:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-03-09T17:13:39.544-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Option odds</title><content type='html'>27.7%

Lately, I've held off because of price or because I had better ideas for the cash.  As recently as &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-i-sold-call-option-on-oracle.html"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;, I was willing to sell another portion of my holdings.  But since then, the price has fallen off far (15.97%) enough for me to switch back to buy mode.
&lt;p&gt;
I've borrowed some key ratios from &lt;a href="http://www.investor.reuters.wallst.com/stocks/Ratios.asp?ticker=ORCL.O"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Ratio                    Oracle  Industry*
-----                    ------  --------
P/E (TTM)                 24.02    31.08
Price to Sales (TTM)       5.39     5.96
Price to Cash Flow (TTM)  18.54    26.05
Price/FCF (TTM)           19.70    31.53
Operating Margin (TTM)    32.40    24.49
Net Profit Margin (TTM)   23.03    19.17
Return on Equity (TTM)    26.79    22.22

* Software &amp; Programming 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is, Oracle is cheap compared to other software companies.  But none of these ratios consider Oracle's superior growth.  Year over year, Oracle has increased sales by 24.72% compared to 18.66% for the industry as a whole.  Now much of the growth has come from the purchase of Siebel systems in January 2006, so we can't expect that growth to be repeated this year.  But it's also becoming clear that the acquisition strategy is working.  In particular, when a customer decides to buy one portion of the Oracle Suite, there is a strong incentive to buy all of their enterprise software from Oracle.  Oracle the platform company is an even better business than Oracle the database company.
&lt;p&gt;
I also must admit that part of the reason I bought more Oracle was to round up an odd lot.  Since Oracle doesn't currently pay a dividend, I intend to sell call options against my position.  Of course, that requires Oracle to increase in price to where it is overvalued.  That might take a few years, however.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4181016469879013263/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4181016469879013263' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4181016469879013263'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4181016469879013263'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-i-doubled-down-on-oracle.html' title='Why I doubled-down on Oracle'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-9074262003298637313</id><published>2007-03-02T15:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-03-02T16:53:29.274-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACVCX'/><title type='text'>Odds of successful call writing</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-i-sold-alberto-culver-call-option.html"&gt;Earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote a call option on my ACV stake.  At the time, I was more concerned about getting paid to sell than loosing out on gains.  This afternoon, I took a look  the odds of exceeding my break-even price at the end of the two weeks.  I calculated that if miss out on any increase of beyond 1.89%.  First, I grabbed all the &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=ACV"&gt;closing prices for ACV&lt;/a&gt; and loaded them into an &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/index.html"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; database.  Then I counted the total number of two week periods in my dataset:
&lt;pre&gt;
sqlite&gt; select count(*)
   ...&gt; from (select * from acv_prices a
   ...&gt;       join acv_prices b
   ...&gt;            on (julianday(b.date) = julianday(a.date) - 14));

5503
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next I counted the number of those periods in which the closing price increased by 1.89% or more:
&lt;pre&gt;
sqlite&gt; select count(*)
   ...&gt; from (select (a.close-b.close)/b.close increase
   ...&gt;       from acv_prices a 
   ...&gt;       join acv_prices b
   ...&gt;            on (julianday(b.date) = julianday(a.date) - 14))
   ...&gt; where increase &gt; 0.0189;

2088
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore, if the past is any indication of the future, there is a 38% (2088/5503) chance my option will be called for a loss.
&lt;p&gt;
One of my goals in writing the option was that I would like to sell my Alberto-Culver shares.  It's likely that a 1% increase will result in my option being assigned, so I also took a look at the number of fortnights in which the stock increased by that percentage or more.  I won't show the code, but it turns out that 2551, or 46% of the periods resulted in greater than 1% increases.  And just for kicks, I looked at the odds ACV will loose value over the fortnight, which is 43%.
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, the odds for each scenario shakes out like this:
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;ACV&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Option&lt;/th&gt;            &lt;th&gt;Odds&lt;/th&gt;              
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Down&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Expire&lt;/td&gt;            &lt;td&gt;43%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Up&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Expire&lt;/td&gt;            &lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Up&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Excerised for gain&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Up&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Excerised for loss&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;38%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;               &lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

At least that's what I feel like saying every year around this time.  Warren Buffett likes to publish his &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2006ar/2006ar.pdf"&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt; to shareholders on a Saturday, but we get Christmas a few days early thanks to new SEC regulations.  Needless to say, Berkshire's actual results were almost as good as its Chairman's commentary and advice.
&lt;p&gt;
This year, I thought it would be fun to present my investment's results using one of Mr. Buffett's favorite tools&amp;mdash;look-through earnings.  Essentially, I calculate my share of each companies earnings by multiplying the quarterly earnings per share by the number of shares I hold each quarter.  Then I aggregate four quarters into a year and divide by the number of "shares" in my IRA.  (For an explanation, see &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2005/07/12/keep-track-of-your-returns.aspx"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;).  This way, I can focus on the economic value the various businesses have added as if I owned each one outright.  All 2007 numbers exist only in the imagination of analysts; I use them as placeholders to get an idea of what the future holds.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Earnings         2007*   2006    2005    2004    2003    2002
Oracle           0.19    0.13    0.21    0.30    0.44    0.34
Canon            0.31    0.28    0.49    0.34    0.08 
Select Comfort   0.26    0.19    0.27   
Berkshire        0.19    0.25    
Alberto-Culver   0.12    0.08    
Sally Beauty     0.04    0.00    
Look-through     1.12    0.93    0.97    0.64    0.52    0.34

* 2007 numbers are consensus analyst estimates.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2006 results are down in part to my purchase of Alberto-Culver and its spun-off subsidiary, Sally Beauty.  I bought these shares more for the value I hoped would be unlocked by the spin-off and for the large special dividend (see below).  Oracle has slowly been losing its share in my personal look-through earnings because it is a smaller part of my overall portfolio.  On an absolute basis, its earnings have increased smartly.
&lt;p&gt;
Last year was the first in which I made more than 2 trades.  Besides three new positions, I added to one of my old positions, executed three going-private, arbitrage transactions, initiated two more and sold one option.  Plus I left substantial (relatively speaking) sums in cash.  So my non-look-through earnings and costs were significant for the first time.  In the following chart, I've included actual year-to-date results in the 2007 column.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Interest         0.01    0.16    0.01    0.03    0.02    0.00
Costs           (0.05)  (0.19)  (0.04)  (0.06)  (0.22)  (0.12)
Arbitrage        0.39    0.41    
Options          0.06     
Operating        1.47    1.32    0.94    0.61    0.32    0.23
Gain            11.28%  40.94%  52.78%  89.99%  41.50% 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My "operating" earnings are more impressive, smooth and meaningful when presented this way.  The market value of my IRA is substantially more lumpy due to market fluctuations.  Note that while the arbitrage earnings are quite significant for last year's results (not to mention this year's), they would be partially offset by a tax cost if this were a taxable account.  I'm also batting 1.000 with a pitifully small sample size.  One day I will experience a setback and the loss may very well wipe out significant gains.
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, if you add in my sale of Oracle a few years ago and the large special dividend from Sally Beauty, you will arrive at some very lumpy net earnings.  Once again, these earnings benefit greatly from the tax-deferred status of the traditional IRA.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;   
Realized Gain                                    1.79 
Special dividend         2.99    
Net              1.47    4.31    0.94    0.61    2.11    0.23
Gain           -65.97% 360.84%  52.78% -71.01% 827.21% 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fun part about looking at results this way, is that it's easy to imagine being at the helm of a large conglomerate controlling an array of subsidiaries.  But this approach ought to also aid an investor's thinking about the businesses he partially owns.  Clearly, I will need to consider eliminating my Alberto-Culver and Sally Beauty stakes in the next few years if they do not improve performance.  I might want to increase my investment in Oracle instead.  Arbitrage and option activities have added considerably to my bottom line.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/4763495991199692188/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=4763495991199692188' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4763495991199692188'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/4763495991199692188'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/look-through-earnings.html' title='Look-through earnings'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7753492653090409730</id><published>2007-02-22T10:27:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-02-22T16:02:32.984-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='EUPA'/><title type='text'>Eupa International shares cashed out</title><content type='html'>My shares of Eupa International were cashed out yesterday for the expected price of 40¢  a share.

It's a consumer products company that mostly caters to women, and my wife doesn't use their products.  My &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-bought-alberto-culver.html"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; was that the spin-off of Sally Beauty would unlock value in Alberto-Culver.  As far as I'm concerned that has already happened.
&lt;p&gt;
But, as it turns out, I just bought a faction of a share of ACV.  Why?  Because I've instructed my broker to reinvest dividends.  If your broker offers dividend reinvestment as a free option on your account, there's no good reason not to buy some fractional shares of a company you already hold.  Alberto-Culver's earnings yield is about 4.22% versus 4.85% that cash would earn.  But remember, companies have the potential to increase earnings over time.
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, I'm attempting to write a call option on the bulk of my holdings.  I've got better ideas than Alberto-Culver at this point and I'm overexposed on this particular stock at roughly 11% of my IRA.  But I'm not quite ready to sell outright.    I like the dividend I'm getting, management seems very shareholder friendly, and I think a few acquisitions combined with cost-savings could push earnings up over the next year or two.  So the middle ground for me is to write slightly out of the money call options until something drastic changes.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/6591375472451155976/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=6591375472451155976' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6591375472451155976'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/6591375472451155976'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/buying-alberto-culver-and-trying-to.html' title='Buying Alberto-Culver (and trying to sell it too)'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1592887982514380694</id><published>2007-02-13T15:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-06-22T12:17:55.576-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQAD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>My stock option insurance business</title><content type='html'>Back in November, I wrote my very first &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-i-sold-call-option-on-oracle.html"&gt;covered call option&lt;/a&gt;.  Since then I've been struggling to understand how I ought to evaluate these transactions&amp;mdash;especially when the option expires worthless.  
&lt;p&gt;
Oracle slid from $19.48 to $17, so there was no possibility that the option would be exercised.  On the one hand, I certainly didn't lose any upside.  On the other, if I had sold my shares instead of the call option, I would have avoided a worse than 11% loss.  I'm not terribly upset about the "loss", however, since I wasn't committed to selling Oracle.  $20 is at the low end of the stock's intrinsic value, and I'm interested in becoming at buyer again now that Oracle is priced under $17.  From the perspective of the option buyer, the option was well worth its price.  Instead of out-right buying Oracle and taking an immediate loss, the buyer has the luxury of buying at much cheaper price or taking a pass altogether.  So who won and who lost in this transaction?
&lt;p&gt;
If you think of an option as an insurance transaction, it becomes more obvious that there don't need to be losers (though often there are).  Although the option buyer lost the premium paid to me, their bigger concern was to avoid the sell-off that did, in fact, occur.  And although I suffered a big, unrealized loss, I would have suffered it whether or not I'd sold a call option.  So like an insurance contract, the party (me) that could afford a sudden price drop sold protection to the other party that couldn't afford it.
&lt;p&gt;
Insurance writing is usually evaluated with a metric called the &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1991.html"&gt;combined ratio&lt;/a&gt;.  It takes any losses, costs or dividends to policy holders and divides by total premiums.  Ratios greater than 100% indicate underwriting loss.  Insurance companies prefer to operate at the lowest possible combined ratio, but can still be profitable thanks to investment gains on the premium float, which is the money that has been paid in and has not yet been paid out in claims.  Based on a single option, my combined ratio is 21.37%, so I'm currently making an underwriting profit.
&lt;p&gt;
The paper loss on the underlying asset (Oracle) is unfortunate, but not really relevant to the activity of writing call options.  Think of the underlying asset as a reserve that is required to ensure that I can pay out a loss.  When my reserve shrinks, it is the result of an investment decision to not sell not because I wrote a call option against it.
&lt;p&gt;
I expect that in the future, I will make a small profit on covered call options.  Thankfully, USAA lowered my commissions, which will lower my cost.  But I will also probably suffer some loses when options I write are exercised and I imagine I will accept smaller premiums than I did with Oracle.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/1592887982514380694/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=1592887982514380694' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1592887982514380694'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/1592887982514380694'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/my-stock-option-insurance-business.html' title='My stock option insurance business'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7167175977123676295</id><published>2007-02-06T12:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-06-24T23:55:52.157-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQAD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MHG'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='XAN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>January performance</title><content type='html'>I haven't written in a while, but my IRA portfolio turned in a spectacular January:

&lt;pre&gt;
Date      S&amp;P 500  Delta   IRA    Delta  BRK A  S&amp;P 500   NAV    BRK A
01/31/07  1.41%    1.07%   2.47%  2.42%  0.05%  1,438.24  24.44  110,050.00
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are a few highlights:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sold &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-i-sold-pegasus-communications.html"&gt;Pegasus Communications&lt;/a&gt; for $3.25 a share.
&lt;li&gt;Bought &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-i-bought-eupa-international.html"&gt;Eupa&lt;/a&gt; for 35¢ a share.
&lt;li&gt;Sold &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-i-bought-pegasus-communications.html"&gt;Meritage Hospitality&lt;/a&gt; for $5.50(!) a share.  (That works out to a 295.71% annualized return.)
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-i-sold-call-option-on-oracle.html"&gt;Oracle call option&lt;/a&gt; expired.  The good news is that I was not forced to sell my Oracle shares.  The bad news is that Oracle lost more than 12% of its value in that time.  Fortunately, I didn't want to sell anyway.
&lt;li&gt;Select Comfort gained nearly 6% for the month.  I guess the shock of bad news in December wore off.
&lt;li&gt;Sally Beauty gained 9% for the month.  I guess the shock of bad news in December wore off.
&lt;li&gt;Alberto-Culver gained nearly 5% for the month based, I suppose, on a 5.5¢ a share quarterly dividend.
&lt;li&gt;Oracle and Canon had poor Januaries based on being large companies with little real news.
&lt;li&gt;Berkshire Hathaway, as you can see above, ended flat.
&lt;li&gt;Earned 4.85% (annualized) on any cash I had lying around.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that my stock prices bounced around randomly.  I'd say the going-private transactions that I've participated in show &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/07/classifying-investment-decisions.html"&gt;true skill&lt;/a&gt; since they've worked exactly as I expected.  My other investments have did well in January mostly due to luck.  Long term, I expect to have more good months than bad ones and make more good decisions than bad, but one month isn't a big enough sample.
&lt;p&gt;
February is turning out to be my best month yet.  My IRA balance right now is over $5 million.  That easily surpasses the &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/09/half-millionaire.html"&gt;half million dollars&lt;/a&gt; I "had" back in September.  But I expect my balance will return to earth shortly when my Eupa are cashed in.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/7167175977123676295/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=7167175977123676295' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7167175977123676295'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/7167175977123676295'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/02/january-performance.html' title='January performance'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116467615908551082</id><published>2007-01-11T11:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T12:35:37.224-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQAD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Covered call writing</title><content type='html'>After I wrote &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-i-sold-call-option-on-oracle.html"&gt;my first covered call option&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed something that I ought to have realized before:

Normally the merger would require some fairly expensive regulatory costs, but by executing a reverse split and suspending the reporting requirements (which require no proxy vote), those costs can be avoided.  It seems to me the transaction is fairly safe now that the notice has been filed with the SEC since the benefits are fairly obvious and compelling.
&lt;p&gt;
I bought in at 35¢ and in a few weeks, I expect to get back 40¢ a share.  This isn't the best profit (someone else bought at 30¢ later in the day), but it should be a fairly quick turnaround.  One nice thing is that I was able to plow in my &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-i-sold-pegasus-communications.html"&gt;Pegasus cash&lt;/a&gt; which should result in an extra $44 gain.

Normally when I enter a going-private position like Pegasus, I initiate a limit-sell order near the cash-out price.  It's sort of a safety valve in case the deal falls through later.  Naturally, if the deal goes through (as this one had), I should raise the limit price to cover the commission cost which I won't have to pay when the reverse-split is paid.  But the whole process is a bit silly since it's unlikely anyone will pay more than the cash-out price to purchase the shares.  For some reason, someone did this time.
&lt;p&gt;
The final tally on the Pegasus Communications position was a 47.55% gain over 18 days.  That works out to a 268,006.81% annualized return.  If I had canceled or raised the limit order, I would have recorded a 111.80% gain, but my annualized return would have been much lower.  Obviously, the total amount of this transaction is trivial.   One nice thing about this deal is that my broker (&lt;a href="http://www.usaa.com"&gt;USAA&lt;/a&gt;) recently lowered my commission from $19.95 to $11.95, which means I'm going to spend a lot less in the future.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116829531982139610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116829531982139610' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116829531982139610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116829531982139610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-i-sold-pegasus-communications.html' title='Why I sold Pegasus Communications'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116793017587447690</id><published>2007-01-04T08:56:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T09:02:55.886-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MHG'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='XAN'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Pegasus Communications and Meritage Hospitality Group</title><content type='html'>In another going-private transaction, I bought 99 shares of Pegasus Communications.

Not only did I outperform both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (13.62%) and Berkshire Hathaway (24.11%), I also posted my best calendar year performance.  After 4 1/2 years of out-performance, I feel confident that my results so far are not a fluke.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A significant factor in my success this year was that my patience with Oracle finally paid off.  I bought at a ridiculously low price and Oracle proceeded to perform quite well and account for nearly all of my IRA's gain for the second half of 2002 and all of 2003.  2004 and 2005 represented a fair amount of uncertainty for Wall Street, which refused to believe that "tech mergers" worked.  This year, the various acquisitions started contributing to the bottom line and Oracle's shares followed (up 40%).  The interesting thing is that Wall Street &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; undervalues Oracle.  Too many analysts focus on new database licenses to the exclusion of higher margin renewals.  Also, I think the Oracle database is under-appreciated as a platform for other businesses to develop new products on.  It's nice that Oracle the company is standing in the wings to buy startups that succeed.
&lt;p&gt;
Canon, at 23% of my portfolio, is tied for my largest holding in large part due to its exceptional performance during 2006 (up 44%).  Once again digital cameras and printer-related consumables continue to be the mainstays of Canon's business.  The digital camera revolution is nearly over in my opinion&amp;mdash;most people have a digital that meets their needs.  Canon is going to have to have a new product boom in the next year or so to keep up their revenue growth.  Perhaps YouTube will do for digital camcorders what &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; did for still cameras.  I think Canon's management is counting on its new flat-screen TV product to drive revenue growth.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort endured a rocky ride this year and ended down 4.6%.  Operationally, nothing much changed in my opinion.  They are still the same company with the same management operating in the same business as when I first bought shares nearly two years ago.  It's entirely possible that macro factors such as the slowing housing market and credit tightening will make 2007 a disappointment, but over the next ten years Select Comfort ought to do very well.  After buying more shares, it is now tied for my largest holding.
&lt;p&gt;
Berkshire Hathaway is up 23.5% since I bought it.  2006 was a spectacular year to be a reinsurer since claims were low and premiums high.  (The catastrophes of 2005 are largely to blame so its possible premiums will head down in 2007.)  Auto insurance continues to be a good business since cars continue to be built safer.  Berkshire's other lines of business seemed to perform well during the year.  From now on, a portion of my portfolio will match Berkshire's results, which is something to keep in mind when I compare my results to it.
&lt;p&gt;
The year end &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/alberto-culver-breakup-value.html"&gt;spin-off math&lt;/a&gt; for Alberto-Culver is Alberto-Culver ($21.47) + Sally Beauty ($7.86) + the special dividend ($25) = $54.33.  Given that I bought at a dollar-weighted average of $49.34 a share, I've made nearly $5 a share or 10% on the spin-off.  Alberto-Culver and Sally Beauty together make up 15% of my portfolio, which is fairly significant.  But I haven't yet decided if they will become core positions.  Both companies have now released initial 10-K reports, which I hope to have a chance to read in-depth soon.  But I think I'll have a better idea of how the new companies operate after a quarter or two.  Also, I'd like to know what Alberto's dividend will be.
&lt;p&gt;
The rest of my portfolio is a smattering of going-private transactions and cash.  I'm also short January 2007 options on Oracle at $20, which should expire without value.  In some ways, this "short-term" portion of my portfolio is the least important.  By their nature, going-private transactions are very profitable, but also very small.  Last year I completed 3 and initiated 2.  But if they were to make a significant impact on my portfolio, I would have had to have completed something like 10.  This year, I'll need to complete even more, since my total portfolio has grown considerably.  On the other hand, since they require little in the way of effort, risk or capital, I see no reason not to continue attempting to make a little profit there.

Since the previous guidance was 95 to 97¢, this was a huge disappointment.  Last year, Select Comfort earned 76¢ a share (after adjusting for a 3/2 split), so the growth this year is between 5 and 14%.  Worse Q4 earnings look to be 21 to 46% &lt;strong&gt;lower&lt;/strong&gt; than 2005.
&lt;p&gt;
What happened?
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061130005288&amp;newsLang=en"&gt;the press release&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“This quarter’s sales have been disappointing, as we’ve noted a closer correlation in our business with housing industry trends. Our sales programs and promotional offers have been consistent with prior years, and we are protecting product margins,” said Bill McLaughlin, Select Comfort chairman and chief executive officer. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For a high-end furniture company, this is actually a decent excuse (though not encouraging).  People moving into a new house tend to want new furniture to go with it and have access to cash from home equity lines of credit.  Also, if the soft housing market foretells a recession (and it seems to be doing just that), customers might be holding off on large purchases for the moment.
&lt;p&gt;
But I think the specific problem for Select Comfort is the new ad campaign, which started this year.  Two of the new commercials are available on &lt;a href="http://www.selectcomfort.com/video/mattress_information.cfm"&gt;the company website&lt;/a&gt; ("Five Senses" and "Revere").  If you aren't paying attention, you might be forgiven if you think these are drug ads (probably for sleep aids, but maybe anti-depressants or ED treatments).  The bed just isn't a big part of the commercial.    Sure, the message is clear if you pay attention, but you've got to figure that the people who aren't fixing themselves a snack are TiVoing through the commercials.  In contrast, the previous commercials were funny and focused on the mattress itself.
&lt;p&gt;
The good news it that Select Comfort has already addressed the problem by &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97149&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_print&amp;ID=928624&amp;highlight="&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; a new ad agency.  Poking around their &lt;a href="http://mckinney-silver.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, I think Select Comfort made a pretty good choice with the one reservation that McKinney also has Southern Comfort as a client.  Overall, they seem to produce polished, memorable commercials often using humor.  Their Sony commercials are especially informative, because like TVs, men and women need to agree on buying the same bed.
&lt;p&gt;
Based on the low earning range ($42,160,000) and low growth range (20% a year), a &lt;a href="http://www.quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=intrinsic&amp;cursym=&amp;csym=SCSS&amp;csym1=&amp;csym2=&amp;initearnec=42160000&amp;egrrbtn=ec&amp;egrdd=0&amp;egrec=20&amp;dcrrbtn=dd&amp;dcrec=15.00&amp;dcrdd=2&amp;passtick=1&amp;p=SCSS"&gt;DCF&lt;/a&gt; shows Select Comfort to be worth over $40 a share.  $18 a share implies a growth rate of about 8%.  &lt;a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/pricecheck/index.cfm?story=worksheet&amp;nav=dropTab"&gt;A more conservative estimate&lt;/a&gt; works out to a fair value of $21.  I'm concerned about  a recession in the next year that could further hurt earnings, but I think the problems are likely to be temporary.  In the meantime, Select Comfort will be able to buyback shares at a reasonable price, improve its advertising and find operating efficiencies.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116500355549999538/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116500355549999538' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116500355549999538'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116500355549999538'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-bought-more-select-comfort-on.html' title='Why I bought more Select Comfort on disappointing news'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116470482099009991</id><published>2006-11-27T23:57:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-28T01:07:01.553-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Selecting mutual funds for my 401(k)</title><content type='html'>When I first branched out into &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-buy-t-rowe-price-small-cap-stock.html"&gt;actively managed funds&lt;/a&gt;, I laid out a 5-part screen to find good funds.

When I first started investing, I had no idea which funds would perform better than others, so I stuck with &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/07/why-i-buy-sp-500.html"&gt;an index fund&lt;/a&gt;.  But having invested on my own, I have a better idea of what works and what doesn't.  Stock tend to do better than bonds, experience is important, buying and selling frequently doesn't help, and expenses are a drag on performance.  I've also noticed that it's easier to make outsized returns on a small sum of man than on a large sum, and managers that care about minority stakeholders produce better returns for them.
&lt;p&gt;
With this extra insight, it ought to be possible to construct a portfolio of funds that will maximize expected return.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116470482099009991' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116470482099009991'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116470482099009991'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116423794293161473</id><published>2006-11-22T12:51:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-27T09:14:07.363-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='options'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORQAD'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Why I sold a call option on Oracle</title><content type='html'>Today I sold a January, 2007 call option on Oracle at a strike price of $20.  The premium was 70¢ a share.  Yesterday (when I placed the limit order for the option) Oracle closed at $19.48.  After commisions and fees, I recorded 2.83% income on the transaction.  On an annualized basis, that's 19.18%.  If the option is assigned, I'll earn 4.47%, which is at least 24.53% annualized.  For me, this is a win-win.
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://www.888options.com/quotes/default.jsp"&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt;, the option was worth 62¢.  I don't know if that's acurate or not, but it doesn't really matter to me.  Option pricing models, such as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes"&gt;Black-Scholes model&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_model"&gt;binomial options model&lt;/a&gt;, are interesting in the acedemic sense, but relying on them for actual options trading seems speculative.  The problem with generic models is that they include volatility among their inputs.  But the odds of a stock reaching a certain price are also influenced by the company's intrisic value and the probability of positive or negative news, which cannot be included in a generic model.
&lt;p&gt;
Writing a call option amounts to a soft sell of Oracle.  I think $20 is a reasonable (though maybe low) selling price, but I'm not ready to put in a limit order.  I also don't see any reason for the price to jump much higher in the next two months.  Oracle Openworld, when Larry Ellison announced the company's Unbreakable Linux initiative, happened in October.  There aren't many big aquisition targets on the horizon.  I doubt the second quarter earnings release will be significantly better than expectations.  In fact, given the persistent inverted &lt;a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/onebond/index.cfm?story=yieldcurve&amp;nav=dropTab"&gt;yield curve&lt;/a&gt;, I suspect stocks in general will be flat at best.

Thankfully, Quicken has a spin-off transaction type.  Unfortunately, it isn't entirely clear how it works.  After fiddling with it for a while, I think I understand the accounting.
&lt;p&gt;
The first principle is that you received both the parent and the spun-off company (plus the dividend) on the day you bought the original shares.  So on September 18, 2006 I bought Alberto-Culver plus Sally Beauty (plus the dividend) for $49.40 a share (and on October 23, 2006 for $49.24).  The spin-off event has a retroactive effect on the original transactions.
&lt;p&gt;
Second, the cost basis for each company is determined by the market on the day of the spin-off.  For the sake of simplicity, I'll use the opening prices, but I have seen the average of the day high and low used.  I believe Alberto-Culver will file the official ratio to be used for tax purposes sometime soon.  At any rate, New Alberto traded at $20.10 and New Sally traded at $7.35 (and the dividend was $25).  For our purposes, I'm going to lump the dividend into the value of New Sally, because the dividend was paid for through the money Sally borrowed.  Therefore, the ratio to use is Sally&amp;mdash;61.68% and New Alberto&amp;mdash;38.32%.
&lt;p&gt;
Third, a "Return of Capital" transaction on the date of purchase lowers the cost basis of the parent company by cost basis of the spun-off company.  So for September  18, Sally Beauty was acquired for 61.68% of $49.40 or $30.47 a share.  (And on October 23 for $30.37 a share.)  Therefore, Alberto's cost basis is reduced by the same amount.
&lt;p&gt;
Fourth, the dividend is recorded as a return on the Sally Beauty investment.  Currently, Sally trades for $8.51 a share, which is quite a bit lower than my original cost.  But when you add in the $25 dividend, those shares have returned about $3 each so far.  Meanwhile, Alberto has gained a little over a dollar a share since I bought it.
&lt;p&gt;
I've been able to get my Yahoo portfolio to more or less work out, but it requires more faking since it doesn't properly account for dividends.  I wish someone would provide a really useful online-portfolio tracking system.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116410273812143071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116410273812143071' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116410273812143071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116410273812143071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/11/accounting-for-spin-offs.html' title='Accounting for spin-offs'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116346809834620287</id><published>2006-11-13T11:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-06-24T23:46:42.946-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><title type='text'>Sally Beauty (when issued)</title><content type='html'>Alberto-Culver shareholders approved the Sally spin-off on Friday and as of today &lt;a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=SBHWI"&gt;Sally shares&lt;/a&gt; are being bought and sold on the "when issued" market.  Since there is also a market for both &lt;a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=ACVWI"&gt;new Alberto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=ACV"&gt;old Alberto&lt;/a&gt;, it's now possible to find out what the market says about the &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/alberto-culver-breakup-value.html"&gt;breakup math&lt;/a&gt;:

$25 (cash) + $7.50 (Sally) + $17.85 (Alberto) = $51.35
&lt;p&gt;
But it is still possible to buy old Alberto for around $50, so there is still time to take advantage of a market inefficiency.  (Basically, index funds that track the S&amp;amp;P 500 need to sell Alberto before the index drops Alberto and replaces it with some other company.)  Although I have a little more cash to invest, I'm holding back for when Sally Beauty trades on the open market and after I have received the $25 dividend.  I still think Sally conservatively is worth 30% more than $7.50.  I suspect that when the company releases financials, the conservative value will be even higher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many salons in the US resemble malls in the way they operate.  Each beautician rents a "chair" from the salon and keeps any profit they earn above that.  Besides the basic services like washing, cutting and styling hair, salons are also an outlet for high end hair and beauty products.  These are products that you can't buy at Wal-Mart or drug stores, because the makers of those products (e.g. Paul Mitchell) are aiming for a "Professional" market.  As a result, there is a distribution problem&amp;mdash;how do manufacturers get their products into the hands of beauticians?
&lt;p&gt;
Enter Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group.  BSG sells only to beauty professionals and Sally sells both to the general public and (under the Sally ProCard program) to professionals.  Wal-Mart, Target and drug stores are more or less locked out of Sally's market pretty much by definition.  On the other end of the spectrum, it's difficult to imagine another company building or buying a distribution network that competes with Sally.
&lt;p&gt;
The one exception is Regis, which is consolidating the salon industry through expansion and acquisitions.  As you might recall, Alberto's original plan was to spinoff Sally and merge it with Regis.  That plan failed in large part because Regis suffered some operational setbacks that made the merger unlikely to succeed.  Ultimately, however, product sales are likely to be merely a sideline in Regis's business.  (Humberto Barreto wrote an interesting &lt;a href="http://www.wabash.edu/dept/economics/Faculty%20Work/Ricardo/RicRent.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that uses the salon business as a modern example of Ricardian Rent Theory.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116346809834620287/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116346809834620287' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116346809834620287'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116346809834620287'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/11/sally-beauty-when-issued.html' title='Sally Beauty (when issued)'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116344585261945845</id><published>2006-11-13T11:23:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-20T16:40:21.923-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Don't break the interface!

For various reasons, the idea was implemented but never properly tested.  Lately, I've been taking some time to go back over the work to see what can be salvaged.
&lt;p&gt;
Our system is a collection of servers that communicate with each other, client software and the database.  One of the servers deals with a specific class of database transactions.  Clients send messages to this server using a complete set of library functions and the server deals with the database according to the messages.  Since the server is stateless, there's no particular reason the clients couldn't working directly with the database itself.
&lt;p&gt;
I suspect the original reason for the server was that it conserved the number of Oracle connections.  But since the server did not originally maintain a persistant connection,</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116344585261945845' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116344585261945845'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116344585261945845'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116269064224180900</id><published>2006-11-04T15:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-21T10:09:53.380-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Simple retirement calculator</title><content type='html'>So many of the calculators I've tried to use to see if I'm on track to retire are too complicated and don't seem to work well for younger people.  I've come up with &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pKxKtZ725FUsIz8w0RP5hfg"&gt;yet another calculator&lt;/a&gt; that's very simple and should be within an order of magnitude of being correct.
&lt;p&gt;
The two biggest problems with retirement calculators is that either they want way too much information ("How much will you spend on clothing per year when you retire?") or they rely on rules of thumb ("You will need 85% of your current income for retirement.").  The trouble with both is that I don't really have any confidence that the results will be accurate or close to it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One way to think of retirement is that you no longer need to work once your investments can provide income for you to live off of for the rest of your life.  Once your investment income matches the income you get from working, you won't need to work anymore.  To put it another way, once the check from your retirement account equals the check from your employer, you can decide to let your money work for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A big obstacle to this scheme is inflation.  50 or a hundred years ago, a million dollars in your bank account would make you independently wealthy.  These days, it qualifies you for a slightly better interest rate.  In order to have income for the rest of your life, you need access to a riskless income investment that will return a constant rate above inflation.  The government offers a Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) bond that meets that need.  Currently, the &lt;a href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/RI/OFNtebnd"&gt;20-year TIPS coupon&lt;/a&gt; is 2%.
&lt;/p&gt;
Now, given a 2% return that is completely protected against inflation, you can replace you current salary if you have 50 times your salary in savings.  Let's use the US Median family as a guinea pig.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  The &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/4person.html"&gt;Median family income&lt;/a&gt; is $65,093 and the &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/Press%2DRelease/www/2001/tables/dp%5Fus%5F2000.PDF"&gt;Median age&lt;/a&gt; is 35.3.  My guess is that the median head of household is much older, but let's not get too gloomy.  The  &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf"&gt;Median net worth&lt;/a&gt; is $55,000, so if Medians retired today, they will be able to earn $1,100 a year from bond interest.  Thankfully, they don't plan on retiring for another 30 years or so.
&lt;p&gt;
In order to retire today, they would need $3,254,650 (or so) that could be put into inflation-protected bonds.  That's 5817.55% more than their current savings.  Leaving out inflation, they need to grow their savings roughly 14.73% a year for the next 30 years in order to retire.  The needed contribution this year is about $8,100.20 (not counting inflation).  That's a lot of money when compared to current income (12.44%), but it's nothing compared to the year before retirement&amp;mdash;then it will require roughly 767.37% of the (then) current income.
&lt;p&gt;
There are two ways for the Median family to reach a retirement savings level: save a portion of current income and increase current savings through investment.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I know this won't terribly meaningful because you can't really compare the median statistics as if they belong to the same person.  On the other hand, Mr. Median is not all that far off from my own situation, so I think it works.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116269064224180900' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116269064224180900'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116269064224180900'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116181013057512390</id><published>2006-10-25T13:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-10-25T14:02:10.656-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>"Select Comfort 3Q Profit Up 22 Percent" or "Select Comfort Falls After 3Q Earnings"</title><content type='html'>After yet another spectacular quarterly report, Select Comfort shares lost 17% today.

According to an analyst, "The weakness in sales is attributed to sluggish consumer demand, cannibalization from retail partner doors, and an unsuccessful advertising campaign launched this year."
&lt;p&gt;
Advertizing is a concern, but more because of its long-term effectivness than this quarter's results.  On the &lt;a href="http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/97/971/97149/items/217786/3Q06EarningsCallTranscript.pdf"&gt;conference call&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Bill McLaughlin said, "I think the learning is that we were attempting to take some of the creative messaging too far towards an emotional payoff where our strength has tended to be more on the fact base of the product benefits and the consumer's appreciation of those consumer benefits. And we've just got to stay focused there more."  To me his statement is a very good sign.

According to the AP, her reasons were "that both Alberto Culver and the new Sally Beauty Holdings face deal-related risk, and that tax obligations from the $25 special dividend may not be known until 2008."  As a result, shares of Alberto-Culver dropped &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=ACV"&gt;from $51.25 to $49.94&lt;/a&gt; that day.
&lt;p&gt;
To address the second issue, depending on New Sally's earnings, the special dividend might be taxed as a dividend, tax-free return of capital, taxable capital gain, or a combination of the above.  The dividend must be reported this tax year (assuming the proposal passes), but the final determination of how it is taxed might not be made until after New Sally's first year in operation at the end of 2007.  For most people, the accounting is going to be ugly.  But since I hold Alberto-Culver in my IRA, the taxes are an interesting side-note.
&lt;p&gt;
The other issue ("deal-related risk") is more of a concern.  Without access to the complete report, it is difficult to know what that phrase represents, but I'd imagine it is a reference to the costs and difficulty of splitting a company in half.  Until they have been separate for a few quarters, investors can't be sure of the extent of "one-time-charges" on or both of the new companies may incur.  On the other hand, it seems to me the businesses have been more or less independent for years and ought to be up to speed quickly.
&lt;p&gt;
Considering &lt;a href="http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-bought-alberto-culver.html"&gt;why I bought shares originally&lt;/a&gt;, Prudential's downgrade is actually a positive sign for me.  In particular, this is further evidence for point "a. Institutions don't want the spinoff (and not because of the investment merits)."  The deal is complicated and it will be a few quarters, if not years, before everything settles down.  Until then, institutions may not be comfortable owning shares in a company that is largely unpredictable.
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, the downgrade and resulting price drop gave me an opportunity to roll the cash I received from two going-private transactions into Alberto-Culver stock.  It seems like the great value investors have a simple capital allocation strategy that I'm trying to emulate.  When you have capital and an investment idea, allocate the capital to the idea.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116164127498043471/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116164127498043471' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116164127498043471'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116164127498043471'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-bought-more-alberto-culver.html' title='Why I bought more Alberto-Culver'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116128937209038734</id><published>2006-10-19T13:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-03T12:06:00.226-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Simple retirement calculation</title><content type='html'>So many of the calculators I've tried to use to see if I'm on track to retire are too complicated and don't seem to work well for younger people.  I've come up with &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pKxKtZ725FUsIz8w0RP5hfg"&gt;yet another calculator&lt;/a&gt; that's very simple and should be within an order of magnitude of being correct.
&lt;p&gt;
The two biggest problems with retirement calculators is that either they want way too much information ("How much will you spend on clothing per year when you retire?") or they rely on rules of thumb ("You will need 85% of your current income for retirement.").  I just don't trust the results because both of these approaches are a sort of black-box solutions.
&lt;p&gt;
My idea is to build a model that requires very little input to estimate your needed savings rate.  To do that, I need to make a bunch of assumptions.  The first assumption is that we can ignore inflation by using current dollars for everything and always adjusting rates for inflation.  The final result to look at is how much needs to be added to savings this year in order to reach your retirement goal, which is in current dollars.  It's not that inflation isn't a big deal (it is), but we don't really know how to predict it with confidence.  Also, using today's dollars gives more intuitive results.
&lt;p&gt;
The second assumption, which follows from the first, is that you will need your current income in order to be comfortable in retirement.  If you are able to pay all your bills with your current income, you ought to be able to pay your bills in retirement.  Again, this leaves out thing like increased health care costs and decreased housing costs, but I believe those will more or less wash out.  This assumption is self-adjusting&amp;mdash;as you get raises, your income needs in retirement go up.  Hopefully, income will be at a peak just before retirement and will have kept up with inflation.  At that point, you might be able to live on less, but you won't be getting any more raises.
&lt;p&gt;
The third assumption is that the only income available in retirement will be the interest off of your net worth.  That means, no pension, no social security, no part-time job, and no business income.  Obviously this sets a higher bar than if you include those income sources, but it's better to have too much than too little.  If a house is included in your net worth, the assumption is that you will take out a reverse mortgage at some point before you retire.
&lt;p&gt;
The fourth assumption is that everyone will have access to a riskless income investment that will return a constant rate above inflation.  I nominate, the government's 20-year inflation protected bond (TIPS).  As I write, it's possible to buy I bond that will earn 2% a year and is completely protected from inflation.  With these assumptions, it's possible to guestimate the principle needed to ensure a comfortable retirement.  Given 2% guaranteed return, you will need 50x your current income in savings.  
&lt;p&gt;
Now we have enoough to build a simple model of retirement savings.  I'm going to use the Median US family as an example. The &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/4person.html"&gt;Median family income&lt;/a&gt; is $65,093 and the &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/Press%2DRelease/www/2001/tables/dp%5Fus%5F2000.PDF"&gt;Median age&lt;/a&gt; is 35.3.  My guess is that the median head of household is much older, but let's not get too gloomy.  The &lt;a href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/RI/OFNtebnd"&gt;20-year TIPS coupon&lt;/a&gt; is 2% and the &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf"&gt;Median net worth&lt;/a&gt; is $55,000.  If Mr. Median retired today, he will be able to earn $1,100 a year from bond interest, so he's far short of his goal.  Thankfully, he doesn't plan on retiring for another 20 years or so.
&lt;p&gt;
So how will the Medians be ready to retire?  The only way is to increase their net worth to $3,254,650 in 2006 dollars.  The math is a bit complicated (which is why we use a &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pKxKtZ725FUsIz8w0RP5hfg"&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;), but in order to achieve that goal by the age of 65, they will have to increase savings by about 14.73% a year.  In order to keep on track, they need to add $8,100.20 to savings this year.  That is the output of the model that ought to have the most meaning&amp;mdash;how much do we need to increase net worth in order to stay on track.
&lt;p&gt;
There are two ways savings can increase over the next year: 1) diverting a portion of current income into savings and 2) investment returns on savings.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116128937209038734' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116128937209038734'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116128937209038734'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116110393744100924</id><published>2006-10-17T09:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-10-17T09:52:17.453-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Eliminate the regressive tax!</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116110393744100924' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116110393744100924'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116110393744100924'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116110091202718407</id><published>2006-10-17T08:57:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-15T12:32:47.650-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><title type='text'>Alberto-Culver breakup value</title><content type='html'>Alberto-Culver shareholders are being asked to vote on a spin-off of
the company's salon products distribution business (Sally Beauty) in
November.  Current owners will receive one share of New Alberto, one
share of 52.5% of New Sally and $25 per Alberto-Culver share.  The
other 47.5% of New Sally will go to a private equity fund (Clayton,
Dubilier &amp; Rice Fund VII) in exchange for $575 million, which works
out to about $6.73 a share.  In order to pay the special $25 dividend,
New Sally will take on $1.85 billion of new debt. 
&lt;p&gt;
Based on the current market value of Alberto-Culver and the implied
purchase price of New Sally, here is a chart showing the valuation of
each piece compared to some competitors: 
&lt;pre&gt;
                  Price/share Price/Sales Price/Earnings EV/EBIT
ACV               51.30       1.35        24.03          14.06 
New Alberto       19.57       1.39        25.70          17.89 
New Sally          6.73       0.50        37.21          13.68 
Cash              25.00    

Procter &amp; Gamble  62.05       2.89        22.69          17.16 
Colgate-Palmolive 60.09       2.72        22.96          16.46 

Personal &amp; Household Prods.   2.6         25.64 
Consumer/Non-Cyclical         2.4         22.1 
    
Regis             38.20       0.72        15.95          10.93 
CVS               31.25       0.69        20.96          15.56 
Walgreen          44.34       0.94        25.53          16.05 
Longs Drug        44.50       0.36        22.60          11.97 
    
Retail (Drugs)                0.72        24 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On this basis, New Alberto is not valued dramatically differently than
current Alberto or other personal products companies.  New Sally,
however, looks cheap according to its P/S since it is closer related
to drug stores and Regis (the salon company that tried to buy Sally
last spring).  Retailers, as middlemen, must carefully control profit
margins in order to remain competitive, unlike consumer product
companies that can nurture a brand to higher margins.  The P/E ratio
is less telling for Sally because it will take on so much debt.
EV/EBIT, which removes the effect of leverage, puts Sally in the
middle of the retail pack. 
&lt;p&gt;
Now, let's look at how the pieces could be evaluated after the
spin-off.  I set New Alberto's price based on the P/E ratio of
Consumer/Non-Cyclical companies and used the P/S ratio of drug
retailers for New Sally's price. 
&lt;pre&gt;
                  Price/share Price/Sales Price/Earnings EV/EBIT
ACV               51.60       1.36        24.17          14.14 
New Alberto       16.83       1.20        22.10          15.38 
New Sally          9.76       0.72        38.56          13.87 
Cash              25.00
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn't too far from the market value of Alberto-Culver, so the
investment thesis is that the spin-off will allow both companies to
operate more efficiently and will reveal the true value of the
underlying businesses. 
&lt;p&gt;
First, all fundamental data I've used is based on 2005 figures since
only 9 months are available for 2006.  So far, 2006 seems to be a fine
year for the combined companies.  EPS for the last 12 months is $2.37
versus $2.09 in the previous 12 months.  I expect the initial
financial statements from both companies will suggest a higher price
per share as well. 
&lt;p&gt;
Second, New Alberto will be debt-free and able to focus on building
its portfolio of brands.  The salon distribution business was a
distraction and didn't provide any operating advantages since few of
Alberto's products where sold in Sally stores or through Beauty
Systems Group.  Dumping debt on New Sally could allow New Alberto to
pursue acquisitions like it recently made with Nexxus and St. Ives.
&lt;p&gt;
Third, CD&amp;R has tremendous motivation to increase the post-spin-off
value of New Sally.  The private equity investment company has
successfully invested in spin-off companies such as Lexmark and Hertz
and only profits if the price of the highly leveraged stock
appreciates significantly.  It's helpful to view Sally as an LBO or
the stub stock of a recapitalization.  
&lt;p&gt;
Fourth, New Sally should be able to expand into new markets and
increase current-store sales through advertising.  Alberto's salon
product distribution business has been hampered in the past because
the parent company is a competitor with other vendors and
predominately distributes through other retailers.  Once free of the
consumer products business, Sally should be able to promote itself
more aggressively.
&lt;p&gt;
I see a purchase of pre-spin-off Alberto as a low risk opportunity to
participate in CD&amp;R's investment.  Depending on how the market values
New Alberto and New Sally, purchasing one or the other could be an
even more rewarding investment.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/116110091202718407/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=116110091202718407' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116110091202718407'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/116110091202718407'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/alberto-culver-breakup-value.html' title='Alberto-Culver breakup value'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-116078497666115614</id><published>2006-10-13T17:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-10-13T17:16:16.673-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Select Comfort bear</title><content type='html'>Recently Select Comfort was the subject of an episode of &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06101213.htm"&gt;Dueling Fools&lt;/a&gt;.

My shares of Advanced Nutraceuticals were cashed out on Oct. 5 at $4 a share.  On an anualized basis, it was 144.12% and one day short of beating &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/03/major-automotive-transaction-completed.html"&gt;Major Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, which was 144.21% annualized, as my best investment.  
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about the comparsion with the S&amp;P 500 and it occured to me that Berkshire Hathaway might be a reasonable benchmark to strive for:

In a little over four years, I've managed to outperform both the S&amp;P 500 and Berkshire, which astounded me.  I can't imagine that will continue for the next four years however, because Berkshire is tremendously undervalued.  Starting this year, some of my performance will be based on the performance of Berkshire thanks to the share I own.  Also, it isn't a fair fight since Mr. Buffett and friends must allocate billions of dollars and can't invest in tiny companies like Advanced Nutraceuticals or even tinyer opportunities like going-private transactions.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115980702615852669/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115980702615852669' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115980702615852669'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115980702615852669'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/10/advanced-nutraceuticals-cashed-out.html' title='Advanced Nutraceuticals cashed out'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115861395298865717</id><published>2006-10-02T08:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-15T12:33:19.942-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ACV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SBH'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Alberto-Culver</title><content type='html'>Alberto-Culver can be divided into two lines of business&amp;mdash;consumer products and beauty salon supply distribution.  As it turns out, Alberto plans to split into two separate companies by spinning off Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group, the distribution segment.  The remaining company, New Alberto-Culver, will continue selling Alberto VO5, TRESemmé, Consort and Nexxus hair products, St. Ives skin care products, Mrs. Dash, Molly McButter, Static Guard, and a few other random products.
&lt;p&gt;
Spinoffs tend to be a good place to find exceptional value. In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684832135/104-1025826-2433542?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jonericson-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0684832135"&gt;You Can Be a Stock Market Genius&lt;/a&gt;, Joel Greenblatt suggests "certain characteristics [that] point to an exceptional spinoff opportunity: a. Institutions don't want the spinoff (and not because of the investment merits).  b. Insiders want the spinoff. c. A previously hidden investment opportunity is uncovered be the spinoff transaction (e.g., a cheap stock, a great business, a leveraged risk/reward situation)."  I believe Alberto-Culver possesses all three characteristics.
&lt;p&gt;
The transaction is a bit complicated, but the results are fairly straightforward: each share of pre-spinoff Alberto-Culver will be converted into a share of New Alberto, a share of New Sally and $25 cash.  A private equity fund (Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice Fund VII), will own 47.5% of New Sally, which will issue $1.85 billion in debt to pay for the dividend.  So how does Alberto meet the criteria?
&lt;ol style = "list-style-type:lower-alpha"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I don't think institutions want any part of the spinoff.  Half of the value of the spinoff is a dividend, and who doesn't like cash?  Well, institutions don't like like large dividends because they are taxable events and need to be reinvested.  New Alberto will have a significantly less interesting growth story without Sally and will be compared to Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble and Unilever.  New Sally is the worst of all: high debt, single-digit stock price, not part of the S&amp;amp;P 500 (so must be sold by index funds), competes against Wal-Mart, Target and drug stores (but not really), and who wants to say they invested in a company called "Sally"?  (To be honest, the whole thing seems a bit "feminine", doesn't it?)  One other problem is the stench of failure since an attempt to spin/merge Sally into Regis Corporation, which runs a chain of salons, when sour earlier this year.
&lt;li&gt;Insiders will continue to be part of both surviving companies acting more or less in their current capacities.  The family of Leonard H. Lavin, Alberto-Culver's founder, will continue to own a significant percentage of both companies and have agreed not to sell for at least a year in order to keep the tax-free status of the spinoff. CD&amp;R has a history of guiding spinoffs to successful operations, such as Lexmark from IBM and Hertz from Ford. The only thing missing is option or restricted stock grants to increase insiders ownership.
&lt;li&gt;Generally a vertically integrated company has tremendous advantages because they have control over every step from manufacture to the final customer sale (think Starbucks). But Alberto-Culver is not integrated with Sally Beauty Shops or Beauty Systems Group, because only a fraction of New Sally's sales are Alberto products. Sally can't give, for instance, TRESemmé products preferential treatment, because Clairol, Revlon, Conair and L'Oreal would be displeased and might pull their products. Also, Sally must limit advertisement since it competes with stores that carry Alberto products. Rather than being an asset to the other, each company is a potential liability.
&lt;/ol&gt;
I had a bunch of other great insights, but Blogger.com managed to corrupt this post.

Including the commision of my purchase, that's a 12.27% gain versus 0.33% if I had invested in the S&amp;amp;P 500.  On an annualized basis, that's 78% which easily exceeds the 5% hurdle I use for these relatively safe going-private investments.
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds great, but I only made $30.  Even if I were able to buy the 1999 shares I wanted to buy and didn't pay a commission, my grand total would have been $199.90, which isn't all that much.  On the other hand, now that I've survived a few of these deals, I don't think it will take more than an hour or so to research new going-private situations.  Mostly, I just need to read the proxy on the SEC's website and do a little math.  If commissions continue to become a less important cost (because of inflation or my broker becomes more generous), these little investments could be even more profitable (though at no larger scale).
&lt;p&gt;
I've been reading Warren Buffett's &lt;a href="http://www.ticonline.com/buffett.partner.letters.html"&gt;Partnership letters&lt;/a&gt;, which provide an interesting "pre-history" to the Berkshire Hathaway letters.  (Berkshire first appears in the January, 1966 letter, but Buffett has made purchases of its stock as far back as 1962.)  One repeated theme in them is the categorization of investements into "general", "workout" and "control".  General investments are purchased because they are cheap (either compared to their liquidation value or relative to similar companies) and tend to move in the same general direction as the market.  Workout investments are purchased because some future event (not just rumored, but published in the paper) will unlock hidden value.  Control investments are companies that the Partnership had influence over by reason of a large ownership stake.  The last two investment types are largely uninfluenced by the general market.
&lt;p&gt;
Until this year, 100% of my investments have been in the general category (or cash), so my results ought to have followed the market.  This year, I've been working in some special situation investments (workouts), so my results ought to be better in down markets and keep up (maybe) in up markets.  (Joy and I do have "control" investments in a sense because of our careers and Joy's Pampered Chef business.  It's difficult to assign a value to them, but they will provide far more earnings to us than our retirement accounts for a great many years.)
&lt;p&gt;
Here are my results since I opened my self-directed IRA:
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
The first "year" (actually closer to 6 months), was entirely the result of a single stock&amp;mdash;Oracle.  2003 and 2004 were poor years as Oracle and Canon lost ground.  In 2005, the addition of Select Comfort made up for the flat performance of the other two holdings.  So far this year, the situation has reversed.  In addition, I've purchased Berkshire, which has not done much so far, and some special situations, which have added to the account's returns.  Beating the market by 14% a year isn't a realistic goal, but the wild swings are likely for a concentrated portfolio.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115948889664774046/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115948889664774046' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115948889664774046'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115948889664774046'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/09/american-education-cashed-out.html' title='American Education cashed out'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115956419847361971</id><published>2006-09-29T13:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-30T15:57:30.789-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>Canon innovations</title><content type='html'>One of the things that makes a consumer products company like Canon successful is finding ways to get the same consumers to buy new products over and over again.  An example of how this can be done is found in a Fortune &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/hftn/060929/091906_8387527.html"&gt;camera review&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Designed for serious amateur photographers but also friendly to the casual point-and-shooter, the Canon Rebel XTi also features a built-in cleaning system that reduces the chance that dust inside the camera will spoil a shot, a bugaboo that plagues most other cameras in its class. No matter how careful one is when changing lenses, dust can enter the camera body to ruin subsequent shots. The XTi literally shakes any dust off the sensor when the camera is turned on or off, using ultrasonic vibrations. The motes are then immobilized on a sticky trap. Also, the camera can "map" stubborn dust particles on the sensor and then erase them from images via software.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These seemingly minor innovations can add up to making older products completely obsolete every few years.  The faster the innovation cycle, the more often consumers will want to get the latest thing and the more sales companies like Canon will make.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115956419847361971/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115956419847361971' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115956419847361971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115956419847361971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/09/canon-innovations.html' title='Canon innovations'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115894829050999546</id><published>2006-09-22T10:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-09-22T16:32:19.206-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BTCP'/><title type='text'>Half-millionaire</title><content type='html'>I just felt like crowing this morning, because my IRA has a market value over a half million dollars.

Fortunately, it seems to have worked out for me, though it wouldn't be the end of the world to have been left with a small, cash-flow positive company with manageable debt and insider-buying.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115894829050999546/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115894829050999546' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115894829050999546'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115894829050999546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/09/half-millionaire.html' title='Half-millionaire'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115803506766982850</id><published>2006-09-11T21:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-09-22T16:02:57.433-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BTCP'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Advanced Nutraceuticals</title><content type='html'>I've gotten a bit behind in my investment rationals, so before I forget, I better write this down.  This is another going-private transaction that was initially priced at $3.20 a share for holders of fewer than 500 shares.  On July 25, the offer was raised to $4 a share.  Up to now, my rule has been to wait for a definative proxy before buying into these sorts of special situations, but I realized that raising the price of the offering is a similar signal that the transaction will happen.  There's no particular reason a company should raise the offer unless the SEC thinks it is unfairly low, so once the offer is raised, there's a good chance the going-private transaction will be approved.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115803506766982850/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115803506766982850' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115803506766982850'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115803506766982850'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-i-bought-advanced-nutraceuticals.html' title='Why I bought Advanced Nutraceuticals'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115387809761698106</id><published>2006-07-25T16:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-09-12T15:49:58.076-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Oracle's open-source strategy</title><content type='html'>Larry Ellison explained Oracle's open-source strategy in a recent &lt;a href="http://software.seekingalpha.com/article/12459"&gt;conference call&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115387809761698106' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115387809761698106'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115387809761698106'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115386518478231332</id><published>2006-07-25T15:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-09-11T21:17:45.406-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='AECC'/><title type='text'>Why I bought American Education Corp</title><content type='html'>American Education is another going-private opportunity that I nearly screwed up.

I had intended on buying 1999 shares so that the commission would be minimal, but I didn't check the "all or none" box when I entered the order on my broker's website.  As a result, I initially only bought 100 shares, which would have cost me a small amount.  Instead, I stand to make a small amount.  My return, however should be &lt;a href="http://www.fool.co.uk/school/2005/sch050926.htm?source=EDSP"&gt;quite satisfactory&lt;/a&gt;.

I pointed out that before 1960 or so, &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/11/sp5007jpg.html"&gt;dividend yield&lt;/a&gt; seemed to track bonds better than earnings.  But the period from 1980 to the present showed another disconnect of earnings from bond yields.  It seems that stocks have been more highly prized than bonds.  (Or to put it another way, investors have settled for a smaller yield when they invest in stocks.)
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know why this should have happened, but I do have a guess.  Since &lt;a href="http://flagship2.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/content/Home/WhyVanguard/AboutVanguardWhoWeAreContent.jsp"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;, it has been possible to buy the world's most important and successful stock indexes at a very low cost.  So average people could get the market average just buy writing a check to Vanguard.  But since people have been systematically buying the S&amp;amp;P, there has always been a buyer of last resort for the 500 companies that happen to be in that index.  And since other funds are now judged against this easily matched yardstick, other funds have become "shadow indexers".  And since these funds are often used by passive (and regular) investors, new money is almost always available to buy the index.  It's a sort of uncertainty principle of indexing&amp;mdash;you can't use an index for investing without changing its valuation.
&lt;p&gt;
But why wouldn't you want to own a group of stocks that have a built in group of purchaser?  Well, for one thing, what happens when those buyers wake up and start selling instead of buying?  But more importantly, 
&lt;p&gt;
In place of the S&amp;amp;P index fund, I'm adding two more funds to my list based on the &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-buy-t-rowe-price-small-cap-stock.html"&gt;screen &lt;/a&gt; I started using a couple years ago.  I have loosened each of the criterion I use by a notch: &lt; 1.5% fees, &lt; 75% turnover and at least 5 years experience.  The main reason is to cast a wider net.

He suggested classifying investment mistakes into 4 categories based on two axes:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Good outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Bad outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Right reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Skill&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bad luck&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Wrong reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Good luck&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mistake&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thinking about the decisions that I've recorded here, I can see that all of the individual stock purchases and the single sell have been very good outcomes.  In fact all of my positions are beating the S&amp;amp;P 500 index and all but one (Berkshire Hathaway) have annualized returns better than 15%.  Looking over the reasons I documented for those decisions, I think I can label my success as mostly skill.  I focused on fundamentals and the fundamentals of each company have been good and improving.
&lt;p&gt;
The mutual fund investments I've made in my 401(k) had mostly good outcomes.  I spent way too much time distrusting active funds (by stayin nearly 100% invested in an index fund) and I picked a poor time to become a bond investor.  In the first case, I think I made a mistake by focusing too much on fees.  In the second case, I think I've had a bit of bad luck.
&lt;p&gt;
But it's a lot harder to evaluate the decisions that &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;haven't&lt;/span&gt; resulted in purchases or sells.  It's a bit harder to analyze "sins of ommission" at least in part because they don't tend to leave traces in our memory.  On the other hand, as Warren Buffett says, there are no called strikes in investing.  It's entirely possible I would have made more money by purchasing my half-thought out or rejected ideas.  But I'm not sure I would be as comfortable with them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/115264749058130681/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=115264749058130681' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115264749058130681'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/115264749058130681'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/07/classifying-investment-decisions.html' title='Classifying investment decisions'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-115153940351680060</id><published>2006-06-28T09:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-07-11T14:00:54.523-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Another micro-arbitrage opportunity?</title><content type='html'>Recently, I tried out &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-i-bought-major-automotive.html"&gt;an arbitrage&lt;/a&gt; that is only practical for very small investors.

Oracle has two basic sources of revenue: new licenses and license renewals.  New licenses are seen by Wall Street as more desirable since they represent revenue growth.  But renewals are much more profitable because Oracle doesn't have to pay a salesman to drum up the bussiness.
&lt;p&gt;
Wall Street would also like to see more of Oracle's revenue growth come from its own products rather than from buying competators.  But if Oracle can obtain customers more cheaply by buying other bussinesses, it's in the company's interest to do so.  The same argument can be made about R&amp;amp;D spending versus buying other company's products.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114669774047454894/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114669774047454894' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114669774047454894'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114669774047454894'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/05/revenues-are-good-costs-are-bad-and.html' title='&quot;Revenues are Good, Costs are Bad&quot; and Other Business Myths'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-114596315045890689</id><published>2006-04-25T03:48:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-04-25T14:35:29.426-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Poorcasting</title><content type='html'>I just want to lay claim to a word I coined in the middle of the night:

Not bad.  In Tokyo, Canon ended at ¥8,300.  $1 = ¥117.38 at the moment, which should mean Canon would trade at $70.67 or so in New York.  It actually ended at $71.32, so there seems to be a small "Japan premium" built into the NYSE price.  Perhaps that is because the market agrees with Bill Gross that the dollar is &lt;a href="http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Late+Breaking+Commentary/IO/2006/IO+April+2006.htm"&gt;headed down&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;against the Yen in particular.
&lt;p&gt;
Naturally, it makes sense to ask if Canon is now overvalued.  &lt;a href="http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=intrinsic&amp;cursym=&amp;csym=CAJ&amp;csym1=&amp;csym2=&amp;initearnec=3%2C316%2C700%2C160&amp;egrrbtn=ec&amp;egrdd=0&amp;egrec=10&amp;dcrrbtn=dd&amp;dcrec=15.00&amp;dcrdd=2&amp;passtick=1&amp;p=CAJ"&gt;Quicken's  DCF model&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the company needs to grow 6.3% over the next 10 years in order to justify its current price when discounted against the S&amp;amp;P 500's long term rate.  Even if Canon doesn't expand into new markets, I think 6-7% growth is very likely.  And if &lt;a href="http://www.canon.com/press/2006/sed2006e03.html"&gt;new products&lt;/a&gt; do succeed, 10+% growth should be possible.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114427131730522504/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114427131730522504' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114427131730522504'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114427131730522504'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/04/bloombergcom-canon.html' title='Bloomberg.com: Canon'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-114420186483410780</id><published>2006-04-04T12:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:49:04.369-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MJRC'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Investment returns redux</title><content type='html'>I discovered an error with the spreadsheet I used to generate &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/04/investment-returns.html"&gt;my investment returns&lt;/a&gt;.

Now I'm 100% both on absolute and relative terms.  Obviously this was a pleasant surprize.  Even better, I've been tracking my &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2005/commentary05071204.htm"&gt;time-weighted internal rate of return&lt;/a&gt; and my IRA is earning about 20% annualized.  Since I've held a lot of cash earning less than 4% most of that time, I feel pretty confident in my ability to make good investments over time.

&lt;dt&gt;Masonite International Corporation
&lt;dd&gt;Went private in the spring of 2005.  I think this is a bug in the SEC's script.
&lt;dt&gt;Obsidian Enterprises, Inc. 
&lt;dd&gt;Went private on March 17.  (Timothy S. Durham is also related to this transaction.)
&lt;dt&gt;Scheid Vineyards Inc.

&lt;dt&gt;Chiron Corp.
&lt;dd&gt;Tender offer valued at $45 a share.  &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CHIR"&gt;Currently trading at $45.70.&lt;/a&gt;  This is an interesting case.  Novartis is trying to by Chiron, which made news recently because it is major supplier of flu vaccine.  But it isn't clear how shareholders will vote, since two proxy advisory services covering the deal are split.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These notes cover March 20 to March 30, and as you can see, there aren't any real prospects here.  Most of these filings cover tender offers and mergers, which are too competitive.  Anyone can make money if they guess the outcome correctly.  Yadkin Valley Company is trading (very thinly) above the offer price.  Asconi Corporation would be only be worth $29 if someone gave you 29 shares, so the commission would kill me.  Scheid Vineyards pays out only $37.  So far, I don't see any worthwhile deals.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114383411023686243/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114383411023686243' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114383411023686243'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114383411023686243'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/03/sc-13e3-filings.html' title='SC 13E3 filings'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-114376930237399917</id><published>2006-03-30T16:37:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-03-30T17:41:42.440-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Raytheon raises its dividend</title><content type='html'>Raytheon &lt;a href="http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=837204&amp;highlight="&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it is raising the quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share.

&lt;p&gt;
Easily the most difficult part of investing in reserve split cashout situations is finding the SEC filing.  Companies that intend to "go private" initially file a SC 13E3 ("Going private transaction by certain issuers").  Later they might file a SC 13E3/A (" [Amend]Going private transaction by certain issuers").  Often those filings refer to either a SC TO-T ("Tender offer statement by Third Party") or a PRER14A ("Preliminary Proxy Soliciting materials") which contain the details of the transaction.  Normally, companies that are merging or buying out all outstanding shares are less interesting than reverse splits.  All of this takes some digging.
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, the SEC offers an &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/currentevents.htm"&gt;interface to recent filings&lt;/a&gt;, but the menu only goes back five business days.  But if you change the URL, you can see filings any number of days old.  Today's 13E3 filings are: &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/cgi-bin/current.pl?q1=0&amp;q2=0&amp;q3=SC+13E3"&gt;http://sec.gov/cgi-bin/current.pl?q1=0&amp;q2=0&amp;q3=SC+13E3&lt;/a&gt;.
The ones filed two weeks ago are: ht&lt;a href="http://sec.gov/cgi-bin/current.pl?q1=9&amp;q2=0&amp;q3=SC+13E3"&gt;tp://sec.gov/cgi-bin/current.pl?q1=9&amp;q2=0&amp;q3=SC+13E3&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The next step is to search through the filings for good or potentially good deals.  Since the same companies might amend their 13E3 filings dozens of times, it's good to take notes so that you don't duplicate research.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114376412849635709/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114376412849635709' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114376412849635709'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114376412849635709'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/03/sec-webpage-hack.html' title='SEC webpage hack'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-114368171834130142</id><published>2006-03-29T16:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-03-29T17:21:58.420-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MJRC'/><title type='text'>Major Automotive transaction completed</title><content type='html'>I bought Major Automotive on &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-i-bought-major-automotive.html"&gt;February 28&lt;/a&gt; for $1.75 a share and received $1.90 a share this morning.  After accounting for commission (on the purchase), I made $129.90 in 29 days.  If I could make this transaction on a continual basis, I'd earn 144% a year.

Of course, the problem is that there aren't enough of these situations and they aren't big enough to constantly do them on a large scale.

Buy, sell or snooze?</title><content type='html'>I think Oracle might be undervalued again.  As you can guess from the title &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/columnist/krantz/2006-03-02-oracle_x.htm"&gt;USATODAY.com - Oracle? Buy, sell or snooze?&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Oracle is sleepy stock that isn't worth pursuing.  That may be (certainly it has been true for last year or so).  Let's go over Matt Krantz's arguments step by step.
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; Measure the stock's risk and reward."
&lt;p&gt;
Beta is the measure of how a stock's price moves in comparision with the overall market.  According to Oracle's beta, the stock is extremely risky.  (It also suggests that Oracle isn't a sleepy stock.)  This chart illistrates the risk.
&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/1600/oracle.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:top; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/400/oracle.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think most people would be happy with this sort of risk, but it's obvious that if you bought at the wrong time (during 2000) you would have lost a ton of money.  On the other hand, if you bought at some of the right times (not during 2000), odds are good you would have come out ok.  (I originally bought in 2002, so I'm feeling pretty good about Oracle right now.)  If you know how to evaluate Oracle, high beta is actually a plus.
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; Examine the stock's earnings multiple."
&lt;p&gt;
According to the article, Oracle looks pretty good from the P/E ratio standpoint.  "But even this should give investors pause, because it shows that Oracle's profitability (defined by return on equity) also has been declining sharply. This is not an encouraging sign."  As a matter of fact, since its peak in 2000, ROE has fallen from 97.5% to 26.6%.  For comparision, Microsoft's ROE peaked in 1997 at 35.3% and fell to 10.9% for 2004.  It's now at 25.5%&amp;mdash;a bit less than Oracle.  Let's just say, I'm not discouraged.
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; Calculate the company's value using forecasted future cash flows."
&lt;p&gt;
Using the &lt;a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/pricecheck/index.cfm"&gt;discount cash flow tool at Smartmoney.com&lt;/a&gt; I find that is worth somewhere between $11.50 (if you take beta into account) and $13.18.  The key assumption is a 12.2% growth rate over the next five years.  I think this growth rate is possible, even likely, but I'll talk about why in a moment.  Since Oracle is currently priced around $12.80, I'd say it's overpriced if you think beta is a good proxy for risk and fairly priced if you don't.
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;b&gt;Step 4:&lt;/b&gt; Check the USA TODAY Stock Meter score."
&lt;p&gt;
To be honest, I don't have any idea what this adds to the argument.  I tried out a few other stocks to see what their "USA TODAY Stock Meter score" might be, and most companies seem to be in the 3.0 region.  I guess I'm not sure what it tries to measure.  
&lt;p&gt;
So the real question is will the aquistions of PeopleSoft and Siebel provide enough extra earnings to make Oracle's current price a bargain?  I think Oracle paid too much for that to happen from cost-cutting alone.  As a shareholder, I'm betting that there will be more opportunities for Oracle to sell expensive bundles to companies as a result of these aquisitions.  I see Oracle in much the same situation that Microsoft was in around 10 years ago.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114142902834882389/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114142902834882389' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114142902834882389'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114142902834882389'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/03/usatodaycom-oracle-buy-sell-or-snooze.html' title='USATODAY.com - Oracle?

Nearly 100% of the reason may be found in a &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009779/000095013606000875/file001.htm"&gt;recent SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven't had many good ideas for long-term investments, so I thought I'd try out an &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2005/commentary05063012.htm"&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for a short-term investment I'd recently read about.  The basic idea is to invest in shares that will be cashed out in order for the company to go private.
&lt;p&gt;
My hurdle rate for short-term investments is the 4-5% that I will be getting from the money market account my cash will be invested in over the next few months.  If I don't expect to earn that rate, I'm better off staying in cash.  The Major Automotive proxy says that anyone holding fewer than 1,000 shares will receive $1.90 in cash if the deal is approved.  So I stand to receive $1,890.10 for my 999 shares.  Including commission ($19.95), I spent $1768.20 to buy my shares, which works out to a $129.90 gain.  Obviously, this isn't going to be a huge investment in absolute terms, but it is a little over 7% rate of return.
&lt;p&gt;
The one thing I don't know, however, is how long it will be before I get the cash.  If the deal is approved at the annual meeting on March 3, and the paperwork takes until the end of the month, I'll be holding the shares for about 1/12 of the year.  On an annualized basis, my return (130%) blows away the hurdle rate.  Of course, it could take longer than that.  But as long as it doesn't become a long-term investment, I'm in good shape.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/114116208691873548/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=114116208691873548' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114116208691873548'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/114116208691873548'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-i-bought-major-automotive.html' title='Why I bought Major Automotive'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-113927950674974104</id><published>2006-02-06T18:31:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-04-27T11:37:58.157-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Berkshire Hathaway</title><content type='html'>Actually the question might be why I didn't buy Berkshire Hathaway earlier.  After all Mr. Buffett's &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html"&gt;annual letters&lt;/a&gt; taught me how to value businesses and inspired me to try my hand at investing in individual stocks.  The basic insurance business is one of the all-time great business models.  Shortly after my wife started her &lt;a href="http://www.pamperedchef.com/index.jsp?localeString=en_us"&gt;Pampered Chef&lt;/a&gt; business, Berkshire bought the company.  I've known about GEICO since long before it advertised in earnest.  And of course, I'm a big fan of Dairy Queen and See's Candy.
&lt;p&gt;
But the strange array of assets that make up the company is a bit hard to value.  Thankfully other people are interested in that question as well.  A little while ago, I discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.creativeacademics.com/finance/IV.html"&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Intrinsivaluator&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, I've substituted a complicated set of models that I don't completely understand for a business that was complicated, but explained in relatively simple terms by Mr. Buffett.  But the nice thing about the models is that we have an objective judgment that extends back through the years.
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, the models suggest that the shares are fairly cheap, but not at "cigar butt" level.  And going back in time, the intrinsic value for the various models seems to grow by fits and starts.  But the price jumps all over the place&amp;mdash;far too cheap in 1981, over valued in 1996, and everywhere in between.  Lots of times, the market seems to have a handle on the value as calculated by the models.
&lt;p&gt;
The real problem with an accurate evaluation, is the nature of the insurance contracts Berkshire writes.  Someday there will be one or more super-catastrophes that could threaten the solvency of Berkshire Hathaway if it became undisciplined.  In his 2002 letter, Mr. Buffett said, "Had Gen Re remained independent, the World Trade Center attack alone would have threatened the company's existence," in reference to a recently acquired reinsurance subsidiary.  But unless and until such a disaster occurs, an insurance company can use the premiums it hasn't yet needed to pay claims (called float) to invest as it sees fit.
&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, investing in Berkshire Hathaway is like investing in a large and sucessful mutual fund.  On the one hand, the past returns look outstanding.  On the other, it becomes harder and harder to find good investments for the cash that keeps rolling in.  Unlike a fund manager, Warren Buffett isn't restricted by investment style or SEC restrictions on funds.  He may buy whole companies&amp;mdash;even privately held companies.  And so far, he's managed to get a good return.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/113927950674974104/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=113927950674974104' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/113927950674974104'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/113927950674974104'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-i-bought-berkshire-hathaway.html' title='Why I bought Berkshire Hathaway'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-113680734535239836</id><published>2006-01-09T03:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-01-09T03:49:05.370-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The purpose of R&amp;D</title><content type='html'>The companies I invest in tend to have a high rate of R&amp;amp;D expenses.

&lt;p&gt;
But creating new products is only part of what I look for in a company's R&amp;amp;D.  I also would like to see research that makes existing products better and cheaper to manufacture.  Not only is it lower risk, it also is harder for other companies to copy.

For one thing, I've been investing in active funds that beat their index over the course of several years.  Also, it seems like the index is &lt;a href="http://www.pimco.com/LeftNav/Product+Focus/2005/Arnott+Fundamental+Indexing+Interview.htm"&gt;biased toward expensive stocks&lt;/a&gt;.  I still like the low fees, but I'm concerned that the indexing strategy will be costly if there is a recession&amp;mdash;especially since P/E ratios are so high.
&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html"&gt;yield curve&lt;/a&gt; inverted slightly.  So I decided to move about half my index fund "ballast" into a bond fund.
&lt;p&gt;
I only considered funds with expense ratios &lt; 0.5% and manager tenure of 10 years or more.  Here are the returns for all candidates in my 401(k) plan:
&lt;pre&gt;
Investment Name   1 Yr 3 Yr 5 Yr 10 Yr LOF
PIMCO Total Return Inst CL 2.58% 4.89% 6.84% 6.98% 8.54%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PIMCO Total Return is the largest of all bond funds in terms of net assets.  For a stock fund, that would be a huge negative, but a bond fund should scale better.  Costs are everything in bond funds, since there is little room to differentiate on the basis of picking individual bonds.  Unlike stock funds, size doesn't lock bond funds out of the best investments.

One study suggested that most investors would do better if they kept all of the stocks they sold.  As it turns out, my only sell order (Oracle) was a great trade, but since I didn't find something to buy (Canon) for 6 months, it wasn't a great investment.  Keeping Oracle would have earned about 14% annualized, and Canon has earned about 13.5% (not counting dividends) since I bought.  But that doesn't count the time that I held cash earning 1% or so interest.

I had made it clear that I wanted to know all of the things he had changed.  He didn't seem willing to do that and for mostly political reasons, I didn't feel I could compel him to give a complete report.  So I settled on a compromise: he'd give me a list of "interface" changes.
&lt;p&gt;
My idea behind that suggestion was that if he fixed a bug or reformatted some code, I really didn't care too much.  But if he changed the way a part of the system operates, I'd like to know the general reasons why.  A couple of weeks later, he checked in his code and reported the changes in the interface as he saw it and I started to test the code.
&lt;p&gt;
Not surprisingly, something broke.  He's an outstanding programmer, but with a large system it isn't easy to make a large number of changes that work right out of the gate in every situation.  After digging around for a few hours, I finally discovered the offending code.  He had replaced an entire source file with a check-in comment something like, "Replaced with working version."  His version changed the semantics of a function call in a way that broke a program in a non-obvious way.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, that sort of change is exactly the sort of thing I was fishing for when I asked about "interface" changes.  His response was that since the function signature hadn't changed, the interface hadn't changed.  And he's correct if we had been talking about syntax.  But I don't care about the syntax interface.  A compiler can tell me if that changed.  I needed to know about semantic changes, which are much more difficult to discover.

Thankfully, Select Comfort's business model allows them to sell beds now and ship them later, so with careful management it should be possible to avoid lower sales if not fewer deliveries.  If the average delivery time goes up only a few days, consumers might not even notice or care.
&lt;p&gt;
The principle of supply and demand might cause problems in the long term, however.  If foam is in short supply over the next few months, companies that need it will bid up the price in order to ensure they have enough to  finish their own products.  Until the supply problem is fixed, Select Comfort is at risk of lower profit margins.
&lt;p&gt;
Company-specific risks like this are hard to predict unless you have a detailed understanding of the micro-economics of an industry.  Even then, the unexpected happens more often the we think.  But good companies with solid capital structures and competent management will survive.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112860085734032603/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112860085734032603' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112860085734032603'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112860085734032603'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/10/price-of-foam.html' title='The price of foam'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112849851510278658</id><published>2005-10-04T23:29:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-10-05T01:13:09.810-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Capital allocation</title><content type='html'>The central idea of capitalism is that money is the score-keeper of economic activity.  Most people would feel that there are numerous other criteria to judge human endeavors than whether or not it makes money.  For instance, artists take pride in creating works that are not commercial, environmentalists oppose companies that pollute, and most people would trade salary for doing what they really enjoy.  And if money didn't somehow represent all of those things, capitalism wouldn't work.
&lt;p&gt;
Consider labor unions.  They demand higher pay and better working conditions for workers at the expense of company profit.  Auto workers over the years have virtually guaranteed that US manufacturers will produce more cars than they can profitably sell.  In essence the unions have won the battle, since it is Ford, GM and Chrysler who are paying the price, and not the workers.  But the war isn't over, and if those companies can't stay in business while paying their wages, all sides will lose.
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, money gets converted into what we really value.  For organized labor, it gets converted into job security at all costs.  Consumers don't particularly care about job security (except their own, of course), but they do care about how much money their car costs.  If paying for job security lowers the cost (unlikely) or raises the quality of cars sufficiently, it could be a good use of capital and the companies will thrive.
&lt;p&gt;
The problem with the communist systems in Eastern Europe and Russia, was that workers where theoretically valued, but poitical influence was valuable.  Over time, the disconnect became unsustainable.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112849851510278658/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112849851510278658' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112849851510278658'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112849851510278658'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/10/capital-allocation.html' title='Capital allocation'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112541083767641883</id><published>2005-08-30T06:53:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-30T16:02:33.935-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>More on Canon</title><content type='html'>This &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_36/b3949072.htm"&gt;Business Week article&lt;/a&gt; includes a quote from the S&amp;amp;P 500 analyst who recently downgraded Canon: "'Canon has been one of the few electronics companies able to maintain double-digit margins, but [Canon's second-quarter operating profit] shows that even Canon isn't immune to price pressure,' says John Yang".  The other concern seems to be who might replace CEO Fujio Mitarai, who is 69.
&lt;p&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://smartmoney.com/pricecheck/index.cfm"&gt;SmartMoney.com's DCF calculator&lt;/a&gt;, Canon's current price assumes about 1.5% earnings growth.  The article suggests 6 to 7% growth which works out to about $60 an ADR.  Given more productivity gains and a return on the company's R&amp;amp;D investment, I think Canon is a good value.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the program was trying to do.
&lt;li&gt;What it expected to have happen.
&lt;li&gt;What actually happened.
&lt;/ol&gt;
This is the same requirements of a good bug report, except that there is no need to show the code used.  And actually, the location of the code (source file and line number) should also be included in an error message unless it's completely obvious.  This is such a common requirement, many systems include source location automatically:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt; 
$ perl -e 'die'
Died at -e line 1.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The more difficult thing, surprisingly, is knowing what errors to report.  Most system errors should be reported, but not if the code tries to work around the problem.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112439191153472952/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112439191153472952' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112439191153472952'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112439191153472952'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/08/writing-good-error-messages.html' title='Writing good error messages'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112432496129574819</id><published>2005-08-17T16:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-08-17T17:29:21.343-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Bad error messages</title><content type='html'>&lt;code&gt;Error: can not locate file....&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What am I supposed to gain from reading that message?  Any information at all would help.  What file?  I know the program must know what file it tried.  Why the ellipsis and the "Error: " string?  This error resulted from a failed stat call, which normally means the file doesn't exist.  But what if it were a permissions problem or a self-reference symlink or the &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; argument exceeded &lt;code&gt;PATH_MAX&lt;/code&gt;?  That's why we have &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strerror&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately I had access to the source and changed it to:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Can not stat /path/to/file: No such file or directory&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The orignal code made this more difficult by using this custom function:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int error_msg(char *error)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know &lt;code&gt;varags&lt;/code&gt; is a pain, but it really does have a place.  There is no reason error messages can't provide more than enough information to debug any problem.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112432496129574819/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112432496129574819' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112432496129574819'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112432496129574819'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/08/bad-error-messages.html' title='Bad error messages'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112328210185822471</id><published>2005-08-05T15:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-08-05T15:48:21.863-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Analog to digital</title><content type='html'>I've been thinking about how &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=aoFyNYAhB1lI&amp;refer=asia"&gt;Canon has profited&lt;/a&gt; from the shift from film to digital cameras, and I started thinking about the decades-long shift in other products.

Hopefully Canon will have its &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2005/04/nano-nano.html"&gt;television partnership with Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; up and running in time for the great analog to digital TV broadcast shift.

(¥112 buys about $1.)  Over the past four quarters Canon has earned $3.73.  That works out to a P/E ration of about 13.  It holds roughly $8.63 a share in net cash and has raised the interim dividend, which strongly suggests the year-end dividend will be raised too.  If you use a discount rate of 11%, the current price implies a growth rate of 1.8%.  But earnings have grown 20% a year over the past 10 years.  My dicount cash flow model suggests the company is worth $100 or so.
&lt;p&gt;
Is Canon cheap because it's a Japanese company that faces greater competition from China?  Are investors afraid the Yen will rise (or fall) dramatically?  Is there some risk Canon executives are running an Enron-style fraud?  I just don't understand.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update (August 5):&lt;/strong&gt; A Standard &amp; Poor's stock report has one possible answer.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We recently reduced our opinion on the shares to hold, from strong buy, after the company posted second quarter earnings per ADR of $0.82, lower than our estimate of $0.86. Revenues grew by 7%, but gross margins narrowed by 234 basis points compared to a year earlier. Although CAJ's cost structure has improved relative to competitors, its second half guidance indicates that it is not immune to declining selling prices of printers, copiers, and digital still cameras.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's the breakdown of Canon's revenue by segment for Q2, 2005:
&lt;pre&gt;
Sales by product                Q2, 2005   Q2, 2004  Change (%)

Business machines:
  Office imaging products      ¥ 292,716  ¥ 284,938     +  2.7
  Computer peripherals           285,445    269,890     +  5.8
  Business information products   25,316     28,119     - 10.0
Cameras                          219,241    190,108     + 15.3
Optical and other products        89,755     77,313     + 16.1
-----                          ---------  ---------     ------ 
Total                          ¥ 912,473  ¥ 850,368     +  7.3
=====                          =========  =========     ======
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that the three biggest segments are also becoming lower margin bussinesses according to S&amp;amp;P.  For instance, operating profit on Business Machines sunk from 21.3% to 19.7%.  Worse, Canon had originally projected an increase to 22.7%.  Cameras, meanwhile, earned about 17%.  Optical and other products had operating profits in the single digits.  So margins are clearly a concern.
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that Canon is a premiere company is several tough industries.  If they are going to keep up earnings growth, they're going to have to steer costumers to higher margin products (color copiers and printers versus monochrome, and SLR cameras versus point-and-shoot).  Also, Canon has to be on the lookout for new products like its flat-screen TV initiative.  Canon has benefited from the recent shift from film to digital cameras, but that shift will eventially run out of steam.  When it does, I'm confident Canon will be ready for what's next.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112268032850048108/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112268032850048108' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112268032850048108'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112268032850048108'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/07/what-am-i-missing.html' title='What am I missing?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112265803719602337</id><published>2005-07-29T10:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:51:09.688-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>Loss-leaders</title><content type='html'>The three companies I bought for my IRA share a common tactic&amp;mdash;selling at low margin in order to win high-margin sales later on.  Select Comfort sold a bunch of discounted beds to Radisson this year.  In exchange, Radisson is using the Sleep Number bed to promote its hotels on TV and thousands of its guests will have a chance to try it out.  Hopefully this will translate into sales at high margin Select Comfort stores or direct sales as people learn more about the product.
&lt;p&gt;
Canon (and other printer manufacturers) sell printers at very low margins in order to gain customers.  They make much higher profits by selling "consumables" (paper and ink).  While it is possible to buy generic brand consumables, they don't tend to produce the same quality as the name brand and don't really save all that much.
&lt;p&gt;
Oracle is quite willing to offer deep discounts on new licenses. (Even as low as free if the rumors are true.)  But that's fine, because customers tend to use Oracle's software for many years and pay a steady stream of revenue to continue licensing the software and get support.  Essentially the continuing revenue more than makes up for discounts at the front-end.  Even better, most applications purchasers will also by Oracle applications servers and databases at a standard price.
&lt;p&gt;
In each case, it's best to think of the discounts as an investment rather then a cost.  Like grocery stores advertising great deals on strawberries and steak in order to draw customers to the store to buy milk and eggs, these companies discount in order to bring in higher margin business.  Ultimately the hope is to use discounts to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; earnings over time.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112265803719602337/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112265803719602337' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112265803719602337'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112265803719602337'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/07/loss-leaders.html' title='Loss-leaders'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112259653499447083</id><published>2005-07-28T17:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:51:53.778-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RTN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>Busy week for my investments</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/1600/rtn_scss_caj.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:top; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/400/rtn_scss_caj.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Select Comfort, Canon and Raytheon all reported earnings this week.  I don't have a fundamentally different view of any of the companies, but it seems the market reacted fairly strongly.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112259653499447083/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112259653499447083' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112259653499447083'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112259653499447083'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/07/busy-week-for-my-investments.html' title='Busy week for my investments'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112247420619598384</id><published>2005-07-27T07:16:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:52:27.650-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>Fear of uncertainty</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/1600/scss_caj.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="float:top; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4421/478/400/scss_caj.gif" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Looks like investors of Select Comfort were nervous about the possibility of an earnings disappointment.  It would have been a great time to buy.  Meanwhile, Canon also reported earnings last night and it's stock price barely budged.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112247420619598384/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112247420619598384' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112247420619598384'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112247420619598384'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/07/fear-of-uncertainty.html' title='Fear of uncertainty'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112232361999534605</id><published>2005-07-25T13:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-16T10:49:29.508-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GE'/><title type='text'>GE mentality</title><content type='html'>Joel Spolsky just wrote an article about &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html"&gt;how software companies make money&lt;/a&gt;.  Basically, since there is no incremental cost to shipping more software, only the top supplier of a certain type of software can survive.  If you aren't number one, you can't sell enough to make back the costs of hiring a bunch of developers to create your product.
&lt;p&gt;
That's why it's so encouraging to me that Oracle's Larry Ellison has embraced the GE mentality: &lt;a href="http://www.ge.com/annual00/letter/page4.html"&gt;"the belief that businesses must be, or become, number one or number two in their marketplaces."&lt;/a&gt;  Oracle already has the number one possition in database, but they needed to buy PeopleSoft in order to remain or become number two in certain applications.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/112232361999534605/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=112232361999534605' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112232361999534605'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/112232361999534605'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/07/ge-mentality.html' title='GE mentality'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-112182292402072250</id><published>2005-07-19T13:29:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-07-30T11:57:54.820-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Only Two Risks</title><content type='html'>I wrote &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2005/02/diversification.html"&gt;previously &lt;/a&gt; about the group of mutual funds I picked for my 401(k) and why owning several makes a certain amount of sense.  Since then, I've become convinced that it's a good idea to own more than one fund even though each fund owns hundreds, if not thousands, of individual stocks.  If diversification is the goal, shouldn't owning the S&amp;P 500 or some other broad segment of the market suffice?
&lt;p&gt;
But diversification is a sub-goal toward the main end of investing&amp;mdash;making money.  There are really only two risks to worry about when you buy mutual funds:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low return on investment.
&lt;li&gt;Needing to redeem shares when they are too cheap.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since funds are required to diversify among many securities, there isn't much risk of losing everything.  In general diversifying increases the first risk, and decreases the second.

This weekend I started making Rosemary-Olive Oil Bread from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679409076/jonericson-20/104-5233625-7316728?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2"&gt;Nancy Silverton's Breads from the La Brea Bakery&lt;/a&gt;.  When I was ready to shape the boules, I decided to reread the description since that step never seemed to work right.  In the past, I'd assumed the boule (French for ball) was rolled like a ball of clay.  But the directions are clearly refering to a horizontal, twisting motion.  I couldn't understand how this was going to work, but this morning I tried it.
&lt;p&gt;
Needless to say, the twisting technique worked beautifully.  And the bread is delicious.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111990391882738030/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111990391882738030' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111990391882738030'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111990391882738030'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/06/discovery.html' title='Discovery'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111904768220421366</id><published>2005-06-17T15:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-06-17T15:34:42.213-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The one that got away</title><content type='html'>I just got an email from a co-worker about his son's "matriculation from elementary school".

It's a complicated issue but one comparison the show made is clearly faulty.  The focused on a town in Ohio that used to be home to a television parts manufacturer that was forced to close because of Chinese price competition.  Meanwhile, a Wal-Mart opened up.  Obviously the Wal-Mart jobs paid much less and offered none of the benefits of the manufacturing jobs.  It would clearly be a huge step down for those people.
&lt;p&gt;
But why would anyone make that transition, except to stay in their hometown?  In contrast, millions of Chinese workers are leaving their agricultural communities to the new industrial cities on the coast in order to get better jobs.  They make nothing compared to what they could make here, but substantially better than what they could do at home.  This is the same process America went through nearly two hundred years ago.
&lt;p&gt;
I imagine most people who lost jobs to China found equivalent or better jobs, or just went into retirement.  They might have moved, or pursued more education, or done something less interesting, but I'd be surprised if too many had to work at Wal-Mart.  The contrast is stark, but not really meaningful.
&lt;p&gt;
The real irony is that people who buy cheap, Chinese-made TVs from Wal-Mart can spend more money on other things, like contributing to PBS programming.  It's a bit of a stretch, I suppose.  On the other hand, we bought our TV at Wal-Mart and this summer we started a Netflix subscription so that we'll have something to watch on it.  Other people pay for cable and buy TiVos, or but DVDs at Wal-Mart.  Surely some of our collective disposable income is creating jobs in the US.
&lt;p&gt;
And it's not like stopping Wal-Mart would keep the high-paying manufacturing jobs here.  Wal-Mart's an easy target, but every retailer is involved with cutting costs by importing from China.  The real problem, if there is one, is that Americans have gotten used to the idea that full employment is it's own goal.  Franklin Roosevelt said it best: "No Country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human resources.  Demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our greatest extravagance.  Morally, it is the greatest menace to our social order."  If you focus on the last sentence, employment seems to be a birthright, but the first sentence makes clear the productivity cost of unemployment.  If the Chinese can make TV parts cheaper and better than we can, we need to find ways to be more productive.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111881275337522122/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111881275337522122' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111881275337522122'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111881275337522122'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/06/is-wal-mart-exporting-jobs.html' title='Is Wal-Mart exporting jobs?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111869299611825809</id><published>2005-06-13T12:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-07-18T12:38:05.446-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Joy's old Palm m100</title><content type='html'>During my vacation to the East Coast last month, I had some time to read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465067093/jonericson-20/104-5233625-7316728?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2"&gt;The Psychology of Everyday Things&lt;/a&gt;.  The book make lots of really great points about how designers have failed users in a wide variety of everyday things, but I was especially struck by the author's desire for a device that very strongly resembles the PDA.  Since the book was written in the late 1980s, the cheap, powerful, simple, connected devices that so many people rely on, didn't exist.
&lt;p&gt;
Joy stopped using the Palm m100 she got &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; when she bought her UCLA class ring.  I'm not sure why, but I think it got replaced by her cell phone.  At any rate, it's been sitting in our desk drawer.  So I bought a few more researchable AAA batteries and started using it to see what all the fuss is about.
&lt;p&gt;
Some observations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a pain to carry around.  I wouldn't have done it at all except that my job forces me to carry a cell phone now, so I carry a messenger bag to work to hold the phone and I throw in the Palm too.
&lt;li&gt;It works better than the Yahoo Messenger alarm for keeping track of meetings and appointments if only because I carry it around more.
&lt;li&gt;The time doesn't get updated when I do a synch with my desktop.  Surely this is an option on newer PDAs.  Actually, a built in GPS or cell phone would solve this too.
&lt;li&gt;It's great to be able to synch with Yahoo address, calendar and todo lists.
&lt;li&gt;I don't bother using Graffiti or the popup keyboard if I can help it.  It's easier to enter things on my desktop.  Of the two, Graffiti seems to be the winner once you get over the learning curve.
&lt;li&gt;Games are a bit slow, but that is a function of the device's age more than anything else.
&lt;li&gt;All-in-one devices (phone, GPS, PDA, camera, etc.) will have a definite advantage  for the average person.  
&lt;li&gt;I have to be sure to enter meeting times as soon as I get an email.  Otherwise, I'll miss them.

There's lots of good stuff there, but one thing that really resonated with me was the idea that parents should focus on their children's character (heart) rather than their behavior.  For instance, as children get older and push the boundaries, parents try to control behavior by implementing rules.  "Don't touch your brother while he's trying to draw."  "This is your side and this is her side."  "After you eat your peas, you can get down and play."
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that children learn to get around the rules faster than parents can make them.  Even if more rules were effective, it wouldn't really be the best way to raise children anyway.  We want our children to be good people, not just do good things.  The distinction is more clear when you think about how children should behave when their parents aren't around.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111387032264075219'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111387032264075219'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111333708249519065</id><published>2005-04-12T11:11:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-30T16:02:33.943-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>"Nano, nano"</title><content type='html'>Before it's even sold one TV, Canon and its SED Inc. joint venture with Toshiba has been &lt;a href="http://www.nanalyze.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1165"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; for violating a patent license.  Nano-Proprietary, Inc. owns a patent for the process of producing SED screens, but sold a royalty-free license to Canon back in 1999 for $5.5 million.  That probably looked like a good deal back then, but given the potential revenues Canon is likely to get from using the license, it doesn't look so good now.
&lt;p&gt;
My inexpert and shallow reading of bits of the contract suggests that Nano-Proprietary will lose the suit and Canon will be able to produce SED TVs royalty-free.  Canon has spent a lot of money on R&amp;D and invested heavily in its subsidiary, so losing the license could be very costly.  Therefore, it is possible that Canon will settle to avoid negative publicity and delays in the product launch.  Ironically, Nano-Proprietary's very weak case increased the probability of pursuing legal action.  There is very little to lose except legal fees and a remote possibility that some court or settlement could grant the company extra revenues.
&lt;p&gt;
Lawsuits like this one are the bread and butter of IP companies.  Since a patent has a limited lifespan (unlike copyrights, which seem to be continually extended for Disney's sake), owners of patents are compelled to either develop them into products (as Canon has done) or license them at the best possible terms (as IP companies do).  Sometimes patent holders sell the license too cheaply because they undervalued its potential, over-estimated its appeal, or simply were desperate for the revenue.  In this case it seems Nano-Proprietary hoped that other companies would pursue SED technology and Canon would be motivated to sign an exclusive license.  Its only recourse now it to attempt legal blackmail à la SCO Unix.  This is just one cost of doing business for IP companies.
&lt;p&gt;
As a Canon shareholder, I don't think this is a huge problem.  The worst case scenario would be a per unit royalty that would add to the overall cost of SED screens.  More likely would be an extra lump sum payment to cover Toshiba or maybe to make the license exclusive.  Most likely, this will only result in legal costs.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111333708249519065/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111333708249519065' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111333708249519065'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111333708249519065'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/04/nano-nano.html' title='&quot;Nano, nano&quot;'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111291326115770739</id><published>2005-04-06T16:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2005-05-11T23:58:13.070-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Why I bought a raft of index funds</title><content type='html'>My wife recently opened her first IRA (tax time you know), and I opened a 529 plan for Joshua.  Since we didn't have much to invest, we were somewhat limited to a handful of options.  Commissions would eat up too much of the investments if we tried to buy individual stocks and most mutual funds require $3000 initial deposit.  
&lt;p&gt;
For Joy's IRA, we opened an account at &lt;a href="https://www.gc.usaa.com/inet/gas_corp/CpStaticPages?PAGEID=cp_aboutusaa"&gt;USAA&lt;/a&gt;, which is where I have my IRA account.  The best choice was &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=USMIX"&gt;USAA Extended Market Index Fund&lt;/a&gt; which tracks the companies that trade on US stock exchanges that are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; part of the S&amp;amp;P 500 index.  It's top holding is Berkshire Hathaway, which owns The Pampered Chef (and Dairy Queen and Gieko and Sees Candy and ...)
&lt;p&gt;
For Joshua's 529, I opened an account with the &lt;a href="http://nysaves.uii.upromise.com/"&gt;New York program&lt;/a&gt;.  It has the advantage of low fees and a relationship with &lt;a href="http://www.upromise.com/"&gt;Upromise&lt;/a&gt;.  California's plan has higher fees and no extra tax advantage.  I've spread the investment evenly between the Vanguard &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VTSMX"&gt;Total Stock Market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VIGRX"&gt;Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VIVAX"&gt;Value&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VIMSX"&gt;Mid-Cap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Snapshot.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=NAESX"&gt;Small-Cap&lt;/a&gt; Index funds.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not as happy about the group of index funds as I would have been a few years ago because I think we are in the beginnings of a bear market when holding the market in general won't work as well as it did in the 1990s.  (Read &lt;a href="http://frontlinethoughts.com/"&gt;Thoughts from the Frontline&lt;/a&gt; for some reasons why this might be true.)  But there are some very powerful advantages to indexing: low fees of course, but also low turnover.  &lt;a href="http://www.vanguard.com/bogle_site/bogle_home.html"&gt;John Bogle&lt;/a&gt;, father of indexing, points out that high turnover costs more in taxable accounts and that commissions are a hidden fee paid by the funds shareholders.  This is why I use turnover and fees when I pick actively managed funds.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111291326115770739/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111291326115770739' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111291326115770739'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111291326115770739'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/04/why-i-bought-raft-of-index-funds.html' title='Why I bought a raft of index funds'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111223928356874799</id><published>2005-03-30T18:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:53:08.548-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Consumer confidence and the long-term investor</title><content type='html'>Yesterday evening, I noticed that Select Comfort had ended the day down about 5%.  It wasn't obvious what had happened&amp;mdash;there was no company news that day.  But after a little while I remembered that the &lt;a href="http://www.conference-board.org/economics/consumerConfidence.cfm"&gt;Consumer Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt; had taken a little dip for the second month in a row.  This is a poll of consumers that is supposed to indicate how likely they are to spend money over the next six months.  Theoretically, if consumers feel good about their current financial situation and their immediate futures, companies that sell directly to them will experience strong sales.  This is especially true for makers of "big ticket" products such as Select Comfort.
&lt;p&gt;
If consumers are really less likely to buy mattresses over the next six months, we can expect a couple of less than stellar quarters.  If this is the beginning of a recession, it could be more like two years of disappointment.  So investors have good reason to worry&amp;mdash;especially if they are going to need cash sometime soon.  Short-term bonds will be considerably less volatile.
&lt;p&gt;
But I have a lot longer time period to consider.  I bought Select Comfort because I beleive it will outperform the market over the next 10 to 15 years.  I wouldn't be too surprised to own both a Select Comfort mattress and Select Comfort stock in 20 years.  If I'm correct, I don't think a bad quarter or two will hurt all that much.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111223928356874799/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111223928356874799' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111223928356874799'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111223928356874799'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/consumer-confidence-and-long-term.html' title='Consumer confidence and the long-term investor'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111209109401552733</id><published>2005-03-29T01:08:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-03-30T16:02:33.944-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>It pays to vote</title><content type='html'>When I got Canon's &lt;a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16988/000114554905000383/k00876e6vk.htm"&gt;proxy for the 2004 annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, I read that the company wants to add an item to their by-laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The objects of the Company shall be to engage in the following business:
...
(8)       Manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I found out that Canon is hoping to sell &lt;a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/march16/acs_kaosr-031605.html"&gt;DNA chips&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to diagnose patients.  From the press reports, it sounds like Canon will be able to use bubble jet technology to print the chips, which could cost far less then current methods.  If successful, these products could help doctors arrive at more accurate diagnoses and researchers understand the genetic code.
&lt;p&gt;
While this is exciting news for investors, there's really no way to know how much future earnings this might generate.  Most likely this will never account for more than a few percent of sales and may never become profitable.  But it's fun to imagine Canon becoming a bioinformatics company at least in part.  Certainly it suggests that Canon's R&amp;D department is functioning well.
&lt;p&gt;
Actually this news is potentially negative as well.  Copy machines, printers and digital cameras are increasingly competitive and low-margin products, in which Canon has remained one step ahead of everyone else.  But as airline investors know, being number one isn't always rewarding.  So Canon is compelled to find new products (such as flat-panel screens and portable printers), which is a riskier strategy than the cost-cutting that marked the last ten years.  
&lt;p&gt;
For the next five years, the company is beginning phase three of its "Excellent Global Corporation Plan".  Now, it will focus on "Healthy Expansion".  Investors can dream that the phrase is quite literal.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111209109401552733/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111209109401552733' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111209109401552733'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111209109401552733'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/it-pays-to-vote.html' title='It pays to vote'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111144416520827213</id><published>2005-03-21T12:41:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-04-04T18:34:40.730-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Signing J. D. Drew</title><content type='html'>I was thinking this weekend about the &lt;a href="http://www.all-baseball.com/richbeat/archives/017084.html"&gt;Drew signing&lt;/a&gt; and I wondered how much the Dodgers expect to pay for each win.  For teams with limited resources (everyone but the Yankees), a major goal of acquiring players is to minimize the dollars spent per win.  Actually, as Doug Pappas &lt;a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1320"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, the goal is to minimize the marginal dollars above the league minimum per "marginal win".  To do better than &lt;a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=3628"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, the Dodgers must spend less than $1.8 million/marginal win.  Drew is earning $11 million with the Dodgers, which is $10.7 million more than the league minimum.  Therefore, the Dodgers are getting a bargain each year Drew nets more than 5.9 marginal wins.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/dt/drewjd01.shtml"&gt;Baseball Prospectus&lt;/a&gt; says that Drew added about 10 wins above a replacement player last year, which would translate into a "fair" salary of about $18.7 million.  In 2002 and 2003, he added only 3.7, which would be a hair below $7 million.  In his six full seasons, Drew has averaged 5.3 WARP, which would be worth about $9.8 million.  According to the Win Shares method, Drew was worth about 11 wins &lt;a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/wsnllead/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, 4 &lt;a href="http://www.baseballgraphs.com/winshares/nlwinshares.html"&gt;the year before&lt;/a&gt; and 5 in &lt;a href="http://www.baseballtruth.com/bbt_winshares.htm"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;.  The methods more or less agree given that Win Shares don't adjust for marginal value.
&lt;p&gt;
Below is a table listing the "fair" salary in millions of dollars if marginal wins are worth $1.8 million plus $300,000 for the league average:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Year Age   WARP  Salary
1998  22    1.3     2.6
1999  23    2.7     5.2
2000  24    4.6     8.6
2001  25    7.1     9.8
2002  26    3.7     7.0
2003  27    3.7     7.0
2004  28   10.2    18.7
&lt;/pre&gt;
And here is a peek into the future:
&lt;pre&gt;
2005  29      ?    11.0
2006  30      ?    11.0
2007  31      ?    11.0?
2008  32      ?    11.0?
2009  33      ?    11.0?
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately the contract depends on what gets filled into those question marks.  If we assume Drew has two years like 2004, the Dodgers will get a phenomenal value, but will probably loose him to another team.  If Drew has typical seasons, the Dodgers will be slightly overpaying, and will probably keep the rest of the contract.  If Drew gets injured, they better have their insurance paid up.  It's the first and third scenarios that cause the biggest concerns.
&lt;p&gt;
Clearly this is a good contract for Drew, since he's guaranteed $55 million and has an option for more.  But it doesn't mean that it's bad for the Dodgers.  In particular, the team seems willing to take on some of the risk of losing Drew to injury in exchange for the possibility of two great years or five good years.
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, it's possible they could get four great years.  The option may only be exercised at the end of the 2006 season, so if Drew misses part of that season to injury, he wouldn't be likely to find a better contract no matter how good he might be in 2005.  On the flip side, he might blow his knee the first week of 2005 and be dead weight on the payroll for the next five years.
&lt;p&gt;
I think it's misleading to think of the option as more or less the same thing as an option in the financial sense.  For one thing, the Dodgers are getting a non-monetary return on their investment.  Sure, if Drew helps the Dodgers to win some games, it will help them sell more tickets, concessions, and advertising.  But the effect is indirect.  A great year might help the Dodgers win the World Series, which would make the contract exceptionally valuable, even if Drew was a bust after that.  Another difference is that there is no market for player options.  The only way to benefit from it is to exercise it or use it as leverage to renegotiate the contract.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111144416520827213/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111144416520827213' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111144416520827213'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111144416520827213'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/signing-j-d-drew.html' title='Signing J.

This of course is why it's good to be a monopoly.  There is a limit to how high Microsoft can set prices, because eventually people will get fed up and leave for something cheaper.  Another way for software companies to grow is to release new versions, which works for a while.  But if there is any way users can continue with the old software or switch to a cheaper option, they will when they notice how often upgrades come along.
&lt;p&gt;
For a long time, Microsoft didn't have to worry about people refusing upgrades, since they ended up buying them each time they bought a new computer.  And Microsoft could justify raising the price by adding features like web browsers, music players and CD burning software.  Recently it has been harder to do these things because of court rulings that limit Microsoft's use of its monopoly.
&lt;p&gt;
One advantage Oracle has is it's subscription model.  Rather than charging customers to get the latest version, Oracle gives it to everyone who has a support contract.  Microsoft is slowly working toward that system with institutions, but it will take a much longer time with individuals.
&lt;p&gt;
The basic point remains: Oracle still has more room for growth than Microsoft.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111102447626961546/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111102447626961546' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111102447626961546'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111102447626961546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/ill-come-in-again.html' title='I&apos;ll come in again.'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111053716082209222</id><published>2005-03-11T00:38:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-03-11T02:51:53.396-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>The difference between Oracle and Microsoft</title><content type='html'>A companies revenue may grow in three ways: the total market may increase, a company's market share may increase, or it may begin operating in new markets.  In its early days, AT&amp;T had a monopoly on telephone systems, so the focus was on increasing the size of the telephone market by installing more lines.  Coke and Pepsi have fought over a relatively constant pie.  Berkshire Hathaway has become a huge company in part by buying companies in a variety of markets.  Raytheon made its name (literally) in vacuum tubes and then diversified into microwaves and missile systems.
&lt;p&gt;
For most companies, total market size is outside of their control and expanding to new market, either organically or through acquisitions, is risky.  So one of the most reliable indicators of future growth is the increase from one year to the next in market share.  This is especially important in industries where it is possible to establish a long-term advantage which isn't impeded by growth.  For instance, Wal-Mart has built a strong reputation on being the low-cost leader in nearly everything it sells &amp;mdash; an advantage that won't quickly disappear.  In fact, its growth helps it put price pressure on the companies that sell to Wal-Mart thereby increasing the advantage.
&lt;p&gt;
Some industries resist monopolies.  For instance, restaurants must carefully balance growth with the danger of over saturating the market.  I know people who would gladly eat every meal at McDonald's, but most of us prefer variety.  It's no surprise that there are only four Spago locations, but ten times as many "Wolfgang Puck" cafes.  These businesses scale with difficulty.
&lt;p&gt;
Software is an industry that scales very easily.  More customers mean more developers, which means more features, reliability, and performance, which virtuously cycles into more customers.  Incremental costs are vanishingly small.  Bigger is better in nearly every way.  Which brings us to Microsoft, the biggest, richest company in an industry that rewards success like no other.  When I was considering buying Oracle a few years ago, I worried most about Microsoft.  It seemed to me that with all its cash, brand recognition and legions of developers, no software company could be safe.  Oracle had held back the tide in the database market, but for how long?
&lt;p&gt;
The final chapters have not been written yet, of course, but I think Oracle will continue to have better growth for years to come.  Think about the ways that a company can grow: market share, market size and new markets.  Currently Microsoft has &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-243527.html"&gt;85%&lt;/a&gt; of its core "client operating system" market.  The market is growing, but not at the same rate as it did during the 1990s when most families bought there first computer.  It's difficult to know how successful Microsoft will ultimately be in some of its newer endeavors, but many of them are not strictly software (Xbox, MSN, hardware, etc).  The recently instituted dividend serves as a clear signal that Microsoft doesn't know what to do with all the cash it generates.
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, Oracle controls about &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2005_mar/database_leader_idc.html"&gt;40%&lt;/a&gt; of the database market.  Picking up market share may be a struggle, especially since customers are reluctant to switch once they have made a purchase.  But Oracle enjoys all of the advantages that the biggest enjoys in the software industry.  Microsoft is still far behind technically and in terms of brand.  There are fewer barriers to overall growth in the server market than the client side, since growth depends more on business needs than on new PCs.  Finally, Oracle has already seen success expanding into new markets with products that are closely related to its database product.  PeopleSoft will help tremendously, simply by bringing in more customers.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111053716082209222/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111053716082209222' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111053716082209222'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111053716082209222'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/difference-between-oracle-and.html' title='The difference between Oracle and Microsoft'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-111022533648939535</id><published>2005-03-07T11:55:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:55:43.407-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='RTN'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SNE'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TM'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GE'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='BRKB'/><title type='text'>Mono-linked chains</title><content type='html'>Warren Buffett just released his &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2004ar/2004ar.pdf"&gt;annual letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;, which explained the results of Berkshire Hathaway in 2004.  He commented on a $579 million loss in a zinc mining loss:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline &amp;mdash; ­&lt;i&gt; stay with simple propositions&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash;­ that we usually apply in investments as well as operations. If only one variable is key to a decision, and the variable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%. But if ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability of success, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35%. In our zinc venture, we solved most of the problems. But one proved intractable, and that was one too many. Since a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, it makes sense to look for &amp;mdash;­ if you'll excuse an oxymoron &amp;mdash;­ mono-linked chains.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is such a good analogy.  I also think it reflects an investment philosophy I didn't know I held until now.  My first (and one of my favorite) investments was Oracle.  Over the years, it has taken some huge, bet-the-company risks.  But in every case (at least from what I remember reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074322504X/jonericson-20"&gt;Softwar&lt;/a&gt;) the risks have involved one, key variable.  For instance, each of the complete software rewrites (which are very risky) pivoted on having a better product at the end of the processes and little else.  Time and again Larry Ellison bet Oracle the company on Oracle the database.  Buying PeopleSoft, in fact, will have been a successful risk if Oracle manages to move a wide variety of applications onto a single database schema.
&lt;p&gt;
Select Comfort is also a one-link chain: the adjustable airbed.  Like Oracle, the company has focused on one, big idea &amp;mdash; the hedgehog approach.  Since Sleep Number beds can fold into a handful of boxes, they are shipped directly to the customer.  Since most people aren't familiar with the idea, Select Comfort stores, commercials, QVC shows, and the website are geared toward showing how the beds improve a person's quality of life.  Since the beds are made to order, customers have a range of choices about which controls, mattress covers, air pumps, pillow tops, sizes (including the Grand King (80" x 98") designed for 6'11" &lt;a href="http://www.selectcomfort.com/articles/articledisplay.cfm?siteLocation=006~004~507-879&amp;content_type_id=11"&gt;Kevin Garnett&lt;/a&gt;), and foundations.  There are any number of things that can go wrong, but as long as it's possible to sell high-quality air mattresses, Select Comfort is probably going to do alright.
&lt;p&gt;
Raytheon is moving in the direction of being a single link.  It used to sell everything from microwave ovens to Patriot missiles.  At some point, this made sense &amp;mdash; microwaves used to be high-technology.  Lately, Raytheon has been selling off or ending businesses that don't fit into the government contracts umbrella.  Increased dependence on one customer might seem foolish except that the customer is schizophrenic.  It still has too many links, but at least management has learned its lesson from the diversification adventure.
&lt;p&gt;
I have a harder time justifying Canon on the "one-link" criteria.  I'm tempted to say optics excellence, but one of Canon's biggest revenue streams is printer ink.   Fujio Mitarai, Canon's CEO, says, " Canon was built on the foundation of original innovative technology."  But I think Canon's success is due to a uniquely Japanese ability to mold thousands of employees to a single philosophy.  Many of Canon's investor relations documents describe the idea of "kyosei", which is translated "living and working together for the common good".  If so, the risk is that this bubbly optimism might fail to produce new and better products at a reasonable expense.
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe it's naive to think that Canon has really implanted kyosei into its culture.  But look at this quote in a &lt;a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/199801/ibuka-e.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; of the death of Sony's founder:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mr. Ibuka has been at the heart of Sony's philosophy. He has sowed the seeds of deep conviction that our products must bring joy and fun to users. Mr. Ibuka always asked himself what was at the core of 'making things,' and thought in broad terms of how these products could enhance people's lives and cultures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Or this quote from the &lt;a href="http://www.toyotaforklift.com/about_us/company_profile/toyotaphilosophy.aspx"&gt;Toyota Forklift division&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At Toyota facilities around the globe, "kaizen" is a word mentioned frequently. The word means "continuous improvement" and is a key factor in Toyota quality.  Kaizen has been incorporated into the Toyota Production System driving our engineering and manufacturing teams to constantly improve our lift trucks. It also drives our service personnel. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coming full circle, Berkshire Hathaway is a horrendously complicated company rivaled only by GE.  Any &lt;a href="http://www.creativeacademics.com/finance/IV.html"&gt;attempt to evaluate the company&lt;/a&gt; would require intimate and detailed knowledge of a company that sells everything from candy to catastrophic re-insurance.  Ultimately, Berkshire investors are risking their investment on the philosophy described in the Berkshire &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2001ar/ownersmanual.html"&gt;"Owner's Manual"&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/111022533648939535/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=111022533648939535' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111022533648939535'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/111022533648939535'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/03/mono-linked-chains.html' title='Mono-linked chains'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110990460844842586</id><published>2005-03-03T14:02:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-03-03T19:03:02.406-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>If at first you don't succeed...</title><content type='html'>I've been playing around with &lt;a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/perltex/"&gt;PerlTeX&lt;/a&gt;, which is an ingenious little system to typeset beautiful documents with the power of Perl.  I was inspired to use it because I wanted to illustrate various interest rate calculations without having to do a lot of work updating numbers.  For instance, how much will $1000 be worth in a year if it earns 5%?  And in two years?  And in 5?  What about if it earns 6% compounded monthly?  None of these is hard individually, but it's tedious and error-prone to do the work by hand.
&lt;p&gt;
TeX is the premier typesetting system for mathematics, but it is worthless for performing calculations.  I spent several hours trying to work out how I might coerce its macro system to print the result of 365/21.  PerlTeX lets me write macros in Perl, so I could calculate Future Value (FV) thusly:
&lt;pre&gt;
\perlnewcommand{\futurevalue}[3]{
  $_[0]*(1 + $_[1])**$_[2];
}

\futurevalue{1000}{.05}{1}
\futurevalue{1000}{.05}{2}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But this doesn't work:
&lt;pre&gt;
\futurevalue{1000}{.05/12}{12}
&lt;/pre&gt;
because ".05/12" isn't evaluated.  Next I tried a very simple command:
&lt;pre&gt;
\perlnewcommand*{\perleval}[1]{
  eval qq{@_};
}

\futurevalue{1000}{\perleval{.05/12}}{12}
&lt;/pre&gt;
but this turned out to be hopeless since TeX refused to expand \perleval first.  (This might be a solvable problem, but I really don't want to know more than I already do about TeX macros.)
&lt;p&gt;
I knew I was on the right track, but I had to sleep on it (and take a shower), before I could hit upon the solution.  I needed to do even more in Perl and only make TeX do typesetting:
&lt;pre&gt;
\perlnewcommand{\perlinit}{
  sub FV{
    $_[0]*(1 + $_[1])**$_[2];
  }
}

\perleval{FV(1000, 0.05/12, 12)}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
\perlinit is never called directly.  It's sole purpose it to load definitions into the Perl namespace when PerlTeX starts up.  \perleval does the work of evaluating Perl expressions.  This is my original solution turned inside out.
&lt;p&gt;
Now I wanted to round to the nearst cent and add a dollar sign:
&lt;pre&gt;
\perleval{sprintf '\$%.2f', FV(1000, 0.05/12, 12)}
&lt;/pre&gt;
But TeX swallowed everything after the % as a comment.  At this point, the answer was clear:
&lt;pre&gt;
\perlnewcommand{\perlinit}{
  sub dollar_fmt {sprintf '\$%.2f', $_[0]};

  sub FV{
    $_[0]*(1 + $_[1])**$_[2];
  }
}

\perleval{dollar_fmt FV(1000, 0.05/12, 12)}

I remember the Netscape saga as well as the next guy, but I think what Microsoft has done is (for once) good for the public at large.
&lt;p&gt;
Windows is lowest-common-denominator software.  Everyone uses it including people who can't afford a system administrator.  It is a waste of time and talent for these people to spend more than a few hours a year fixing their OS.  For years I would have long phone conversations with my dad to solve his computer (read Windows) problems.  And I could count on spending an afternoon trying to fix things every time I came home from college.  Fortunately, a combination of his understanding and Windows usability has eliminated those duties.  But I still have to help my grandparents set up their email.  And help my in-laws get rid of viruses and spyware.
&lt;p&gt;
I have a dirty little secret.  I don't know what I'm doing either.  My entire professional life and much of my personal life has been spent working on computers and it took me a few weeks to upgrade to Windows XP.  Moments after I installed it the first time, my computer was invaded by a virus (MyDoom I think) that caused it to reboot every time I connected to the Internet.
&lt;p&gt;
Things would be worse if Linux were the LCD OS.  I'm glad that I don't have to remove spyware for Joy's sister anymore.  She can just run Microsoft's anti-spyware software.  It would be better if Windows security wasn't as loose as a prostitute, but failing that, at least Microsoft is starting to give out medicine and vacines.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110926772678416644/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110926772678416644' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110926772678416644'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110926772678416644'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/lowest-common-denominator.html' title='Lowest common denominator'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110868472601393780</id><published>2005-02-17T15:58:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-17T15:58:46.016-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Socially Responsible Investing</title><content type='html'>http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2005/commentary05021605.htm?source=mppromo</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110868472601393780'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110868472601393780'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110868464632579907</id><published>2005-02-17T15:55:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-03-14T15:40:33.813-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Raytheon's red flags</title><content type='html'>I'm looking at Raytheon's &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2005/02/financial-red-flags.html"&gt;red flags&lt;/a&gt; first, since it is my oldest investment and has had red flags almost as long as I've owned it.  Unfortunately the only thing I can do is hold on at wait until the sell restrictions timeout.
&lt;p&gt;
Profit margin is the first red flag.  In general, I prefer companies with high margins, since they have more room for error.  Wal-Mart has to work hard to get more products to more customer in order to maintain earnings.  Microsoft just has to release a new version of Windows or Office, which are extremely high margin, and watch the profits roll in.  Falling margins are a concern for any company since it means they are either lowering prices or increasing costs.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Years Ended December 31:      2004    2003    2002    2001    2000    1999    1998
      
Gross Margin                 16.36   17.17   20.30   14.69   20.26   20.45   25.29
Operating Margin              6.86    7.27   10.64    4.78    9.99    9.26   13.01
Net Margin                    2.06    2.02   (3.82)  (4.71)   0.87    2.35    4.86
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Net margins were negative in 2001 and 2002 because of cost related to businesses Raytheon was trying to exit.  Margins got a boost in 2002, partially due to post-Sept. 11 spending.  Since the 1980s, margins in the defense business have been reduced due to increased regulation on government contracts and rules requiring certain contracts be designated for small or minority-owned businesses.  Consolidation has helped, but margins have shrunk over the last few years.
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes, the income statement isn't the best guide to a company's finances, since a lot of the numbers are accounting fiction.  They are related to reality in much the same way that income tax returns are related to a household's finances.  For instance, accounting rules allow companies to report the cost of big purchases (such as other companies, new factories and new equipment) over several years rather than all at once.  If that seems odd, think about how you might account for the purchase of a new car or a house if you didn't take out a loan.  In some ways, it's more honest to do things this way since the costs show up over the time period that the benefits appear.
&lt;p&gt;
One way to check net margin, is to compare it to free-cash-flow margin.  To calculate free cash flow, back out non-cash earnings from net earnings and add back "capital expenses".  Warren Buffett talks about this in the Appendix of his &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1986.html"&gt;1986 Letter to Shareholders&lt;/a&gt;.  Over a long period of time, aggregate earnings should match aggregate free cash flow.  Since cash flow is more difficult to abuse than earnings, it's usually a good idea to compare net margins to FCF margins.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Net Margin                    2.06    2.02   (3.82)  (4.71)   0.87    2.35    4.86
FCF Margin                    6.97    5.76    2.64   (2.60)   3.34   (4.89)   2.48
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On average, FCF margins are a bit better than net margins in this time period.  (1.96% versus 0.52% to be precise.)  During the 90s, Raytheon bought several companies, so it carries a lot of goodwill that needs to be amortized.  It also has had to take non-cash charges to fund its pension fund.  Improving FCF is good news for Raytheon shareholders depending on how management plans to use the cash.  As it turns out, management announced that it would raise the dividend, which is both good for investors and a sign that management is confident that Raytheon can sustain cash flow.
&lt;p&gt;
Inventories are another possible red flag, because they represent risk that a company is taking on.  If it can't sell its inventory, it may need to mark it down.  The inventory numbers look pretty good:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Inventory days outstanding      31      40      44      50      44      41      42
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Receivables are at the other end of the sales chain from inventories.  Instead of hoping that you can sell something later, you hope you can get paid for what has already been sold.  Raytheon's biggest customer (the US government) is going to pay up, but many of the smaller customers (foreign governments, buyers of private jets, and other contractors) are more risky.  In any case, the numbers are looking better:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Receivables days outstanding     9      10      15      11      12      17      13
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Debt is the final red flag that is perhaps most likely to destroy companies.  Other forms of leveraging (such as derivatives and partially owned subsidaries) may not show up on the balance sheet, so it's good to look through the footnotes.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Debt Ratio                    0.11    0.09    0.07    0.13    0.09    0.02    0.05
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Flow Ratio                    1.28    1.50    1.68    1.89    1.79    1.80    1.38
R&amp;D ratio                     2.43    2.69    2.68    2.85    3.21    2.95    3.35

(My managers obviously don't read &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html"&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/a&gt;.)  I know that he has a very loose accounting system, but I thought it would be amusing to imagine what sort of things he might be on the lookout for if he did keep track.  Obviously revenue and earnings would be high on the list.  If he found out he was losing money or fewer people were buying stuff, he might get concerned.  These are basic, but how might he notice the trends earlier?  What red flags would warn him of trouble?
&lt;p&gt;
My coworker buys his wares when they go on sale at the grocery store and sells everything for 50¢.  His profit margin depends exclusively on how much he pays for the stuff he sells.  If the grocery store raises prices or people buy more of the expensive items, his margin would go down.  If he raised his prices, his margin would go up, but his sales might go down.  So changes in margin over time are danger signs.
&lt;p&gt;
The office store's best selling item is Diet Coke.  As it turns out, diet sodas go bad over time because the sugar substitute breaks down.  Most of the time, this isn't a problem because people buy the stuff almost before it gets cold.  But suppose there was a big sale at the grocery and some of the best customers went of vacation for a few weeks.  It's possible some of the Diet Coke could go bad and have to be thrown out.  On the other hand, if inventories got low and our office had a bunch of late meetings, the store might lose sales because it runs out.  Inventory changes are potential problems.
&lt;p&gt;
Most people pay as soon as they buy from the store.  A few people put in extra so that they don't have to deal with paying a few hours later.  But some people run a tab or use IOUs.  Unfortunately, people aren't always honest, sometimes forget how much they owe, or leave the company before repaying.  These risks increase as the amount owed increases.  On the other hand, if my coworker forced people to pay as they go, he might lose some sales, so changes in receivables (either increases or decreases) are worth investigation.
&lt;p&gt;
Suppose my coworker decided to buy a bigger refrigerator.  Since the business doesn't make enough to pay for one out of its cash flow, he'd have to borrow money.  In and of itself that isn't a bad thing, but it would be important to monitor how big an impact the new equipment and new debt is making on the sales and earnings.  Big spending projects, especially those that involve adding debt, should be watched closely.
&lt;p&gt;
All of these are extremely simple to monitor in public companies, just by reading the most recent quarterly report.  The mainstream press rapidly reports earnings and sales, but rarely digs much deaper.  But simple danger signs like this can warn of trouble a quarter or two in advance.  I plan to go over all the companies I directly own to see what signs or trouble they might have.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110811330261222735/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110811330261222735' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110811330261222735'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110811330261222735'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/financial-red-flags.html' title='Financial Red Flags'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110799962849556468</id><published>2005-02-09T17:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-09T17:40:28.496-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Why Google isn't worried about Microsoft</title><content type='html'>I was look for information about the &lt;a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.removal.tool.html"&gt;Blaster worm&lt;/a&gt; and I found a link labeled: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/blast.asp"&gt;What You Should Know About the Blaster Worm and Its Variants&lt;/a&gt;.  Google says that there are &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Awww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fincident%2Fblast.asp"&gt;248 links&lt;/a&gt; to that page.  But if you follow it, you read, "Were sorry, but there is no Microsoft.com Web page that matches your entry. It is possible you typed the address incorrectly, or the page may no longer exist."
&lt;p&gt;
I found that the correct link is &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/blast.mspx"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/blast.mspx&lt;/a&gt;, which is only different in the extension.

&lt;p&gt;
Why did Microsoft decide to move things around like that?  If this were the only example, I'd assume it was an oversight or something.  But as long as I can remember, the Microsoft website has been "a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  Ultimately it says to me that Microsoft still doesn't understand the Internet and probably never will.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110799962849556468/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110799962849556468' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110799962849556468'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110799962849556468'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/why-google-isnt-worried-about.html' title='Why Google isn&apos;t worried about Microsoft'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110799300860100009</id><published>2005-02-09T10:23:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-03-07T14:28:14.243-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Select Comfort</title><content type='html'>For our first bed, Joy and I bought a expanded queen Sleep Number mattress and foundation from Select Comfort.  I think you can guess where I'm headed.  Our bed has performed flawlessly.  My sleep number is 55 (0 is the softest and 100 is the firmest) and Joy's is about 35, we never would have found a conventional mattress that would have worked for us.  When Joy was pregnant, she could adjust so that she had good support, but still be comfortable.  I sometimes have a sore neck, but it goes away if I make my side a bit more firm.  (I set it softer if I have sore shoulder muscles.)
&lt;p&gt;
At the time, I looked into buying Select Comfort stock for my portfolio.  Peter Lynch talks about how much effort people go to buying things like pantyhose, microwaves and cars, yet they throw money at companies they don't understand or research.  He suggests people would be better off buying shares of the companies that make the products they buy.  If I had followed that advice, I would have had a four-bagger or more.  But I was worried about both our bed and the company.  Now I feel pretty comfortable about both.
&lt;p&gt;
At the time, Select Comfort was a "penny stock", which hovered around $5.  It also was owned in large part by a &lt;a href="http://www.stpaulvc.com/index.html"&gt;St. Paul Venture Capital&lt;/a&gt; that had bought the bed maker and turned it around.  Eventually it would want to cash out, and I wasn't comfortable with what it might do to shareholder value.  In fact, in May 2003 Select Comfort had a secondary offering at $13 a share which diluted shares significantly.  (Oddly it didn't hurt the price of those shares.  I suspect that I wasn't the only one waiting to see what the "exit strategy" would be.)
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, I heard that one of my cousins had bought a Select Comfort bed that he replaced a little while later.  I don't know the details, but it made me wonder if getting an air bed was really such a good idea.  Traditional mattresses, whatever their weaknesses, just seem more "solid" than air-, water-, and foam-filled mattresses.
&lt;p&gt;
Time corrected my view of these factors.  My bed works great and I don't see why other people won't have the same sort of experience.  I think the VC has done most of  its damage.  (Though in fairness, it really did turn a failing company around.)  At the same time, Select Comfort's remarkable advantages are becoming more clear.  It control's most of its distribution channels, it avoids holding much finished inventory by direct shipping products to the customer, and it has a unique and growing brand name.  Unlike its department store and showroom competitors, Select Comfort needs only a little mall storefront to demonstrate a handful of models.  On average each locatation generates over a million dollars in revenue per year.  I recently noticed their logo on the Extreme Home Makeover TV show.
&lt;p&gt;
I bought Select Comfort on Feb. 9, 2005 at $19.95 a share.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110799300860100009/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110799300860100009' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110799300860100009'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110799300860100009'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/why-i-bought-select-comfort.html' title='Why I bought Select Comfort'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110791256181158085</id><published>2005-02-08T15:38:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-17T16:07:31.173-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Look-through earnings</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110791256181158085'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110791256181158085'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110747319940378208</id><published>2005-02-03T15:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-06T21:59:48.106-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Diversification</title><content type='html'>I reran &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-buy-t-rowe-price-small-cap-stock.html"&gt;my fund screen&lt;/a&gt; for the options in my 401(k) at the beginning of the year:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 					Non-Load Adjusted Returns
Investment Name                         1 Yr	3 Yr	5 Yr	10 Yr	LOF
---------------                         ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring Class I	19.68%	--	--	--	32.86%
Fidelity Equity-Income Fund		11.29%	6.21%	4.31%	11.94%	13.19%
First Eagle Overseas Inst CL		22.10%	24.97%	16.88%	--	16.78%
T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock SHS	18.77%	10.48%	10.91%	14.51%	13.74%
Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund Admiral Class	18.47%	7.28%	--	--	9.51%

S&amp;P 500® Index Fund			10.86%	3.69%	-2.12%	12.09%	13.30%
Raytheon Stock Fund			31.78%	8.68%	10.83%	4.11%	8.81%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There aren't 10 year returns on some of these funds because they've added fund "classes" which merely change the fee structure.  In each case, the expenses have gone down, so I'm not complaining.  All of these funds (except the Raytheon fund) have long-tenured managers.  Here is the performance (from &lt;a href="http://www.morningstar.com"&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;) of the base funds:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring		15.84%	10.86%	6.42%	17.33%	--
First Eagle Overseas 			20.90%	24.88%	17.02%	14.74%	--
Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund 			10.08%	6.24%	0.89%	15.24%	--
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an ideal world, I could just pick the best fund (probably the Value &amp; Restructuring Fund), put all my savings in it and forget about it until I'm nearing retirement.  The problem with that idea is that it is risky.  Of all the funds listed, the safest is the S&amp;P 500 index fund.  It has the lowest fees, turnover, volatility, and the longest management tenure.  The only major risk it has is market risk.  If there is a catastrophe (either financial, like the 1987 crash, or not, such as the September 11 attacks), the fund would lose money.  Of course, all the rest of the funds would probably lose money too.  On the downside, the index fund has a lower return than the other options.
&lt;p&gt;
Probably the highest risk (and certainly for &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/07/why-i-buy-raytheon-stock.html"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;) is the Raytheon stock fund, since it only invests in one company.  Everyone who invested in Enron (especially in Enron 401(k) plans) knows how this is risky.  Of course, there is a potential for disproportionate returns.  An individual company might find ingenious new ways to make or to lose money.  Or in Enron's case both.
&lt;p&gt;
Mutual funds only need to hold about a dozen uncorrelated stocks in order to eliminate the risk of owning too few stocks.  (Most own many more.)  But fund holdings are always related in some way or another.  A small cap fund could do poorly in years when small companies in general are doing poorly.  Or a fund could make a series of disastrous decisions.  Or it could defraud its shareholders.  Or it could slip into mediocrity.  In any case, it doesn't hurt to spread your bets if you think you have several good options.
&lt;p&gt;
The upshot of this is that after years of being invested mostly in the S&amp;P 500 Index, I'm going to add First Eagle Overseas and Vanguard Primecap to my 401(k).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110747319940378208/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110747319940378208' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110747319940378208'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110747319940378208'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/diversification.html' title='Diversification'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110730142843570239</id><published>2005-02-01T15:42:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-01T15:43:48.436-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Induction</title><content type='html'>&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coffeebean.com/"&gt;Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/"&gt;Ikea&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lego.com"&gt;Lego&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louises.com"&gt;Louise's Trattoria&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.samys.com"&gt;Samy's Camera&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.traderjoes.com"&gt;Trader Joe's&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.robbinsbros.com/"&gt;Robbin's Brothers&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://global.vanguard.com/international/hAsiEN/research/USOppEN.html"&gt;PRIMECAP Management&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can be difficult to find out who owns these companies, but the best place to start is &lt;a href="http://hoovers.com"&gt;Hoovers&lt;/a&gt;, which is owned by &lt;a href="http://www.dnb.com"&gt;Dun &amp; Bradstreet&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course there is no way to know if these companies would actually make good investments.  For instance, I was pretty excited about &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; until I saw how much people paid in the IPO.  &lt;a href="http://www.buildabear.com"&gt;Build-A-Bear Workshop&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty good until just before it went public and had to release it's finances.  But these private companies look like solid businesses that could be very profitable to own.
&lt;p&gt;
I've done business with all of the companies listed in one way or another, and they all impress me.  Except Ikea and Lego, they started in Los Angeles.  I feel like I would have an edge when it comes to evaluating them.  Mostlikely, few of these companies will go public, but I'm ready for them!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110730135488341452/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110730135488341452' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110730135488341452'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110730135488341452'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/02/privately-held-companies.html' title='Privately-held companies'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110722259799179946</id><published>2005-01-31T17:18:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-01T17:32:34.100-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Defensive Win Shares redux</title><content type='html'>Back in &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/08/defensive-win-shares.html"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, I suggested that the Lo Duca's defense might be overstated by defensive Win Shares.  One test would be to see if his defense remained stable from the Dodgers to the Marlins.  As it happens, he had 5.3 defensive Win Shares in LA and 1.8 in Florida.  That's over 779 2/3 innings verus 413, which works out to 0.00680 WS/inn. vs. 0.00436.  So it would appear that Lo Duca benefited from the Dodgers good defense.
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, this is a really small sample.  It's easy to imagine a catcher slowing down over the season and becoming less effective, which is just the reputation Lo Duca has.  A better study would include lots of trades with catchers moving from bad defensive teams to good and vice versa.  This still might not be enough.
&lt;p&gt;
The other way to look at the effect of the trade would be to compare team defense before and afterwards.  The data isn't really available, however.  (At least not without doing a lot of work.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110722259799179946/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110722259799179946' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110722259799179946'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110722259799179946'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/01/defensive-win-shares-redux.html' title='Defensive Win Shares redux'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109900928017665575</id><published>2005-01-28T17:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-03T15:11:18.250-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Knowing if you have a skill</title><content type='html'>http://www.apa.org/journals/psp/psp7761121.html</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109900928017665575'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109900928017665575'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109106410005762832</id><published>2005-01-28T15:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-02-03T15:11:46.463-08:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>First order</title><content type='html'>In a &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/07/first-and-second-order.html"&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; I made a distinction between primary and secondary things.

I mean, why would anyone pay $149 a user for &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/Std_One.html"&gt;Oracle Database Standard Edition One&lt;/a&gt;, when they could get &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; free?    Assuming they have the same functionality (which they don't), the answer is the cost of changing database software.  Joel Spolsky has an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; explaining why companies might support open source software even to the point of paying developers to work on it.  You should go read that article if you promise to come right back.
&lt;p&gt;
More informed?  Good.  Ok, Oracle is happy to have, for instance, open source file systems that are optimized for running their database.  And it probably doesn't bother them too much to have open source "Application Servers", like &lt;a href="http://www.jboss.org/products/jbossas"&gt;JBoss&lt;/a&gt;, even though they offer a competing product.  That's because they want complements to be cheap so they can charge more for their core product: the database.  So why aren't they more worried about open source databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL?
&lt;p&gt;
It's clear that Oracle has lowered their price on the very basic versions of the database in response to not just open-source products, but Microsoft and other low-cost providers.  At the high-end, there has been price pressure on Enterprise Edition as well, but that doesn't have much to do with open source.  Obviously Oracle would love to charge more for low-end products, but they aren't making the big money on small customers.  Selling to small customers is a bonus (especially if they eventually become big).
&lt;p&gt;
From a strictly technical point of view, PostgreSQL is the only real open source competitor to Oracle.  Unlike MySQL (and most commercial database systems), Oracle uses multiple versions of the data stored in the database, which means different applications can change and access the database at the same time without bring it to a standstill.  On top of this base, Oracle has designed a system to spread the database across a cluster of computers.  PostgreSQL doesn't yet have this ability, but it is only a matter of time before someone will make it happen.
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, Oracle is trying to diversify away from reliance on the database product, which is the purpose of buying PeopleSoft/JD Edwards.  If you read SEC filings of many different companies, you've probably noticed charges labeled "SAP" that occur over the course of several quarters.  Huge software/process upgrades like this are the market that Oracle is trying to tap into, and open source software is a compliment for these systems.  This is doubly so if Oracle manages to build up it's outsourcing business.
&lt;p&gt;
As was brought out in the anti-trust trial, most of the applications companies buy are not all that difficult to duplicate.  Basic accounting and human resources functions can be found in any number of products.  More difficult (especially if not built on Oracle's database), is moving all of a company's information into one place.    Vastly more difficult than that is creating a structure to hold all the data of any particular organization.  </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110350674931050092/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110350674931050092' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110350674931050092'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110350674931050092'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2005/01/open-source-risk-for-oracle.html' title='Open source risk for Oracle?'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110575589476962185</id><published>2005-01-14T18:10:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-01-14T20:37:20.963-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Your 2005 LA Dodgers</title><content type='html'>I recently finished &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931584036/jonericson-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2"&gt;Win Shares&lt;/a&gt;, so I got curious how the new Dodgers compare to the old Dodgers.  First, the additions:

&lt;pre&gt;
Player         Team   POS    Bat  Pitch Field  ExpWS    WSP   WSAA Total
J Drew         ATL    OF    29.4    0.0   4.8     17   .986     17    34
J Kent         HOU    2B    15.9    0.0   7.4     16   .711      7    23

R Ledee        PHI    OF     4.7    0.0   1.1      3   .819      2     6
D Lowe         BOS    P      0.2    5.4   0.0     10   .272     -5     6
P Bako         CHC    C     -0.2    0.0   1.6      4   .166     -3     1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That works out to be roughly 28 wins.  Now, here's what they lost:

&lt;pre&gt;
A Beltre       LAD    3B    31.2    0.0   6.1     18  1.031     19    37
A Cora         LAD    2B    11.9    0.0   5.1     14   .622      3    17

J Hernandez    LAD    2B     7.5    0.0   2.3      7   .741      3    10
S Finley       LAD    OF     7.1    0.0   2.0      7   .673      2     9
S Finley       ARI    OF     6.7    0.0   2.9     12   .399     -2     9
J Lima         LAD    P     -1.1   10.6   0.0      8   .583      1     9
R Ventura      LAD    1B     5.3    0.2   0.7      5   .681      2     6
B Mayne        ARI    C      0.4    0.0   1.0      3   .242     -2     1
B Mayne        LAD    C     -1.4    0.0   1.4      3   .000     -3     0
H Nomo         LAD    P     -1.1   -5.4   0.0      4  -.808    -10    -6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's 38 wins (or 36 if you give the Dodgers credit for losing Nomo).  I included Finley and Mayne's stats with the Diamondbacks because if they had stayed Dodgers and contributed the same in 2005 as they did in 2004, the Dodgers would be beneficiaries of the entire season's statistics.
&lt;p&gt;
WSAA is a &lt;a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com"&gt;Hardball Times&lt;/a&gt; stat (Win Shares Above Average) that tries to correct for players who get a lot of playing time and some Win Shares, but hurt their team overall.  The new additions increase wins above average by about 6 and the guys who are leaving add about 4.  The discrepancy is largely due to guys like Shawn Green, who added 16 win shares but was expected to contribute 18.  In other words, this off-season has been largely about replacing players who contribute less then they should for players who contribute more.  The two biggest exceptions are Beltre and Lowe.
&lt;p&gt;
To quantify that a bit more, the new players were expected to get 63 win shares and actually got 84.  The old players were expected to get 99 win shares and got 108.  That works out to 0.667 Win Share rate versus 0.545.  Assuming players do about the same they did last year, the new Dodgers should be a better than the old.
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the players who haven't moved (as far as I can tell):

The still-Dodgers had 146 Win Shares and were expected to get 125.  When you add in the new players 84, you could estimate that the Dodgers will get about 77 wins.  Ultimately, the Dodgers need to distribute more playing time to more efficient players in order to improve in 2005.

All of my stock purchase and sales have been executed as limit orders, which means that I pick a price and my broker tries to get it for me.  In contrast market orders are executed at whatever price the broker can find on the open market.  Since I have a pretty good idea what I want to pay (or receive) for a stock, and since I live on the West Coast and don't get up early for the opening bell, limit orders work well for me.  A further twist to limit orders is the Good-Until-Canceled order which let's me leave the order open for 30 day, until I cancel it, or the order is executed at my price.  That way I can set a price, forget about my account for a month, and not miss opportunities.
&lt;p&gt;
The danger, of course, is missing out on a great stock because it never quite falls low enough or selling too late if the price never quite reaches my "reserve".  In fact, I had money to spend almost all year, tried to buy Select Comfort, Pixar and Canon at various times, but couldn't because my limit orders never got executed.  Finally, I ran against the deadline of making at least one trade a year, yet again.  Canon seems way undervalued according to the intrinsic value calculations I've done.  I guess it trades at something like a 30 to 50% discount.  Considering Canon's impressive growth and ~1% dividend, I jumped at the chance to buy at $50.
&lt;p&gt;
Actually I started at $49, but when that price wasn't reached after a week or so, I tried $50.  On November 30, Canon's day low was $50.01 so my order was not executed.  I was tempted to try a market order the next day, but I resisted.  Since Canon trades primarily on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, it's relatively easy to guess the next day's price in New York -- just convert the closing price in Tokyo from yen to dollars.  On December 1, I found out that my broker had executed my order at $49.66, which was &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=CAJ&amp;a=08&amp;b=15&amp;c=2000&amp;d=11&amp;e=1&amp;f=2004&amp;g=d"&gt;that day's low&lt;/a&gt;.  Since the market price was less than my limit price, my patience paid off in a small way.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110245206959956489/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110245206959956489' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110245206959956489'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110245206959956489'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-bought-canon-again.html' title='Why I bought Canon (again)'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110315140216680254</id><published>2004-12-13T13:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-12-15T17:30:01.716-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Glad I didn't short PeopleSoft!</title><content type='html'>I suggested back in &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/09/short-peoplesoft.html"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt; that shorting PeopleSoft would be a pretty good risk.  I was horribly wrong.  Anyone who tried it would have lost about $7.15 a share.  That would be an annualized loss of about 7% (depending on commissions).  In short, it was a terrible investment idea.
&lt;p&gt;
According to Larry Ellison some of PeopleSoft's ongoing revenue was better than Oracle had estimated.  I sure hope so, because it's difficult to see how this deal makes sense otherwise.  I've had 18 months to ponder this and it seems to me that the only way this deal works in Oracle's favor is if they can retain PeopleSoft's revenue and cut the fat.  Using Quicken's intrinsic value &lt;a href="http://www.quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=intrinsic&amp;cursym=&amp;csym=PSFT&amp;csym1=&amp;csym2=&amp;initearnec=534%2C000%2C000&amp;egrrbtn=ec&amp;egrdd=0&amp;egrec=5&amp;dcrrbtn=dd&amp;dcrec=15.00&amp;dcrdd=2&amp;passtick=1&amp;p=PSFT"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
Revenue (TTM)            = $2.67 (billion)
Assumed operating margin = 20%
Assumed operating income = $0.534(billion)
Assumed growth rate      = 5%
Discount rate            = 11%
Intrinsic value          = ~$25
&lt;/pre&gt;
It appears Oracle is overpaying about $1.50 a share.
&lt;p&gt;
I've had to make a ton of assumptions, which presumably Oracle management didn't have to do.  For instance, maybe there are more costs that can be cut or perhaps there are deals in PeopleSoft's pipeline that we don't know about.  But the possibility exists that Oracle was over-eager to get the deal done.  It's troubling that the final price is just 50¢ more than the previous high bid, because it seems like a face-saving device for the PeopleSoft board, rather than a robustly calculated number.  Also, Ellison pointed out that he didn't really see anything that surprised him in the PeopleSoft numbers, just that he didn't have to be so conservative in his estimates.  We have a strong tendency to see the things we want to see.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110315140216680254/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110315140216680254' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110315140216680254'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110315140216680254'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/12/glad-i-didnt-short-peoplesoft.html' title='Glad I didn&apos;t short PeopleSoft!'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110264760701633767</id><published>2004-12-09T18:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-12-09T19:00:07.016-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Surname Distribution in the U.S.</title><content type='html'>It is now possible to see the influence of Ericsons spread from &lt;a href="http://www.hamrick.com/names/names.cgi?surname=Ericson&amp;year=1920&amp;type=html"&gt;1920 &lt;/a&gt;to &lt;a href="http://www.hamrick.com/names/names.cgi?surname=Ericson&amp;year=1990&amp;type=html"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;.

And since I'm way over-exposed to Raytheon and I don't think it's a particularly good buy, I won't.  That means I need to find other things to invest.  Also, I still want to diversify away from the S&amp;P 500.  &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-buy-t-rowe-price-small-cap-stock.html"&gt;My screen&lt;/a&gt; didn't show enough funds, so I started playing around with relaxed criteria.  As it turns out, when I eliminated the manager tenure requirement I found this fund:

&lt;pre&gt;
 					Non-Load Adjusted Returns
Investment Name                         1 Yr	3 Yr	5 Yr	10 Yr	LOF
---------------                         ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring		19.56%	11.48%	8.83%	15.89%	17.22%
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fidelity doesn't know that David J. Williams, the fund's manager, has been &lt;a href="http://excelsiorfunds.com/vlre-fr-ind-mp.htm"&gt;either manager or co-manager since the fund started&lt;/a&gt; in 1992.  I decided that this is good enough to meet my requirements even if Fidelity doesn't agree.
&lt;p&gt;
When looking at companies, there is normally too much information.  I don't think I could ever bring myself to buy McDonald's no matter how great an investment it might be, because I don't like their product.  The opposite is true of Oracle -- I'll probably hang on too long because I like their database.  It's irrational and puts me at a disadvantage.
&lt;p&gt;
Mutual funds have nearly the opposite problem.  The only thing it produces are investment returns and all you know about how a fund gets them is reading some generic phrases in the prospectus.  Just about everything can (and often is) manipulated by the fund management.  For instance, the top holdings are sometimes changed at the last minute to give the appearance that the manager picked hot stocks (like Taser this year).  (There's even a term for this: "window dressing".)
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I like about the Value &amp; Restructuring fund is the handful of presentations and essays found on it's website.  Value investing is interesting to me since I buy individual stocks.  The "restructuring" aspect of the fund should also be fun to watch.  For instance, the fund bought Black &amp; Decker during a restructuring in 2002.  The tool maker needed to reduce costs by shifting production to places like Mexico and the Czech Republic.  It also needed to control inventories -- especially of seasonal products.  In Peter Lynch's parlance, it's been a two-bagger since then.
&lt;p&gt;
The fund commentary also talks about disappointments, such as AOL Time Warner.  I don't know if the fund will do better than it's benchmarks over the next few years, but I appreciate the honesty.  It feels less like throwing darts and more like investing.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110237959198954588/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110237959198954588' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110237959198954588'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110237959198954588'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/12/why-i-buy-excelsior-value.html' title='Why I buy the Excelsior Value &amp; Restructuring fund'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110211267174221776</id><published>2004-12-03T13:07:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-12-03T14:26:27.656-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>"That ship has sailed"</title><content type='html'>A while ago I used the phrase "that ship has sailed" in anger, but I wasn't sure why.  I mean, I hadn't thought to use it before and I wasn't even sure I had used it correctly.  It was like slipping into a foreign language in the middle of a conversation.
&lt;p&gt;
Since then, I've noticed lots of other people who use the phrase -- sitcom actors, columnists, bloggers, and so on.  I can't decide whether I started noticing because of my (embarrassingly inept) use of the phrase or if I'm part of broad attempt at popularizing it.  One way to gather information about this might be to use Google's newsgroup archive.  The phrase was first used in &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22that+ship+has+sailed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;scoring=d&amp;start=820&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt; (at least in groups archived by Google).  Roughly 3/4 of the references are after &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22that+ship+has+sailed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;scoring=d&amp;start=630&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;.    In the last year it's been used about &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22that+ship+has+sailed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;scoring=d&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0"&gt;200 &lt;/a&gt; out of 829 times.  Of course the volume of posts have increased as well.
&lt;p&gt;
One way to work around the problem would be to find a "control phrase" which has not changed frequency over the same period.  Maybe, "sounds good to me" or "I don't think so".  Even better, use a group of phrases.  Then compare the change in frequency to the control.  Best would be if Google published volume statistics by year.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110211267174221776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110211267174221776' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110211267174221776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110211267174221776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/12/that-ship-has-sailed_03.html' title='&quot;That ship has sailed&quot;'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-110202013467653542</id><published>2004-12-02T11:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-12-02T15:14:55.166-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Why I buy the T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock fund</title><content type='html'>Most of my retirement savings are tied up in my 401(k) plan, which from the beginning I've invested in a S&amp;P 500 Index fund and Raytheon stock.  I don't (currently) have much choice is the Raytheon investment, but my plan offers many options besides the index fund.  I didn't spend much time looking at other options, mostly because I didn't know how to evaluate them.  Who cares if a fund beat the market last year -- I want to know if it will beat the market for the next 30 years.
&lt;p&gt;
Last spring, the Motley Fool hired &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/about/staff/ShannonZimmerman/archive.htm"&gt;Shannon Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt; from Morningstar to cover Mutual funds.  I've read the Fool as far back as when my family used AOL in the early 90s, and this was the first time I'd considered the idea that actively-managed mutual funds could consistently out-perform the market as a whole.  Based on his first few months of articles, I came up with a screen to find the best candidates my 401(k) plan offered.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stock Investments&lt;/h3&gt;
At some point I should diversify to bonds for a percentage of my portfolio, but I'm young, interest rates are still going up, and stocks should continue to outperform bonds over the long-haul.  I may need to re-evaluate this criteria in time.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expense Ratio &lt;= 1.00%&lt;/h3&gt;
I wish I could get a fund that charged less than 0.5%, but actively managed funds don't usually come that cheap.  Expenses for investors are like friction to bicyclists -- a drag.  You can bet that Lance Armstrong has the smoothest ride possible because a poorly lubricated part could shave seconds off his time.  We could trade bikes and he would still beat me, but he'd probably be dead last if he used my bike in the Tour de France.  So the lower fee, the better, when it comes to mutual funds.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equity Turnover Ratio &lt;= 50%&lt;/h3&gt; 
Besides being another form of drag (trading expenses are reflected in the NAV, not the expense ratio), excessive trading is a sign of a manager who is chasing performance rather than evaluating companies from the bottom up.  I'm looking for a manager who knows how to pick stocks that will beat the market over the long-term, not managers who get lucky trading over the short-term.  50% churn translates to an average holding period of 2 years.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manager Tenure &gt;= 10 years&lt;/h3&gt;
I'm going to compare 10 year annualized returns, so it makes sense that I compare funds that have been under the same management for that period.  The actual experience of a particular manager might be a lot more than his tenure on a particular fund, so if I were interested in a particular manager I wouldn't care too much if he were with a fund for only a short time.  But so far I don't know any managers who fit that description.
&lt;p&gt;
Here is the result of that screen (as of today):
&lt;pre&gt;
 					Non-Load Adjusted Returns
Investment Name                         1 Yr	3 Yr	5 Yr	10 Yr	LOF
---------------                         ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
Fidelity Equity-Income Fund		11.98%	6.52%	2.69%	10.72%	13.03%
T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock SHS	15.17%	11.76%	11.80%	13.13%	13.57%
Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund Admiral Class	14.53%	--	--	--	7.39%

S&amp;P 500 INDEX FUND			13.77% 	4.16% 	-1.15% 	11.12% 	13.07%
Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund 			17.86%	7.07%	3.38%	15.48%	--
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical returns&lt;/h3&gt;
I had to add the S&amp;P 500 Index fund, since the screen didn't know the expense ratio (something less than 0.1%), turnover (&lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/Holdings.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VFINX&amp;fdtab=portfolio"&gt;about 2%&lt;/a&gt;) or management tenure (effectively forever).  I also added the Vanguard PRIMECAP fund information from &lt;a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/Fund/TotalReturns.asp?Country=USA&amp;Symbol=VPMCX&amp;fdtab=returns"&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;, since the "Admiral Class" doesn't have a very long history.  (I think the difference is in fee structure or something.) The Life Of Fund (LOF) number is fairly meaningless since a fund started in 1982 will look better than one started in 1999.
&lt;p&gt;
The T. Rowe Price fund seemed the best investment last spring because it beat the market in good times and bad, and I didn't have any exposure to small companies.  In general, carefully picked small companies should do better than larger companies because there is more room to grow.  People didn't become millionaires by investing in Microsoft in 1999, but in 1989 when it was relatively small and unknown.

It was, oddly enough, the day my son, Joshua, was born.  If you're imagining me on the phone with my broker while my wife struggled to give birth to my firstborn, stop that!  For one thing, it isn't nice to imagine such a private moment, and for another I initiated the trade days before.  Mainly I sold because I had to.  That is, my brokerage charges a fee if I don't make at least one trade in 12 months.  Also, Oracle was somewhat expensive in my opinion, though not so much that sold all of my shares.
&lt;p&gt;
Shortly after I sold, Oracle began it's hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft.  This was not a huge surprise for people who had listened to Larry Ellison, since he'd been suggesting that the enterprise software business had matured.  Lots of analysts criticized the offer, since Oracle's price and revenue dropped off a bit.  But as a long-term shareholder, I was pleased.  PeopleSoft's operations could be minimized so that most of it's revenue ends up as profit for Oracle if the deal goes through.  
&lt;p&gt;
As time goes on, I think Oracle (and other business software makers) will become more like cyclical stocks than growth stocks.  As the economy picks up, companies will buy more licenses and when there is a recession, companies will cut spending on infrastructure.  If that happens, I plan to look around for other places to invest.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/110091865019846280/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=110091865019846280' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110091865019846280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/110091865019846280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/11/why-i-sold-oracle.html' title='Why I sold Oracle'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109956002389787221</id><published>2004-11-16T18:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-11-16T18:27:31.486-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='^GSPC'/><title type='text'>Earnings yield</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_5.jpg"&gt;Another striking chart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Irrational Exuberance&lt;/i&gt; shows a history of P/E ratios for the S&amp;P 500 with "bubble" years (1901, 1929, 1966 and 2000) marked at P/E peaks.  Perhaps the most striking part of the graph is the most recent bubble which boasted a ratio near 45 compared to 25 in 1901, 32 in 1929, and 24 in 1966.  Looking at the right side of the graph, it's easy to imagine a depression on the same scale as the 1930s!  Once again, I think there are some misleading elements to the chart.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/11/value.html"&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; I suggested that 15 might be a fair P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500, but that's obviously a simplification.  For one thing, if when earnings are expected to grow in the future, it would be sensible to pay more for them now.  That's why people bought companies like Amazon and Yahoo before they started turning a profit.  Obviously some people overpaid for those growing earnings, but it's difficult to say exactly what P/E ratio is fair.  (Yahoo entered the index in December of 1999, so it contributed to the record bubble valuation.)
&lt;p&gt;
A difficulty with P/E ratios is that the don't mean much without context.  One way to fix that is to convert them into earnings yields (earnings/price * 100%).  It should be obvious that an earnings yield can be compared to bond yields, and therefore during periods of low interest rates earning yields should be low (and P/E ratios high).  The logical bonds to compare to would be corporate bonds such as &lt;a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BAA/downloaddata/BAA.txt"&gt;Moody's Baa&lt;/a&gt;.  (Seasoned bonds are bonds sold on the open market.)  If you look at the right-hand side &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_6.jpg"&gt;the chart&lt;/a&gt; which shows that relationship, it looks highly correlated.
&lt;p&gt;
But what happened before 1960 or so?  One obvious difference is that companies made a transition from paying dividends to retaining earnings.  The left-hand side of &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_7.jpg"&gt;the chart comparing dividend yields to bond yields&lt;/a&gt; correlates better than earnings yields.  There are still unexplained divergences in the 1950s and I really should measure the correlation rather than eye-balling it, but I think the results are better than bare P/E ratios.
&lt;p&gt;
None of this, of course, changes the conclusion that the S&amp;P 500 is currently richly priced.  Earnings must grow dramatically to compensate for the risk of owning stock rather than holding bonds.  Remember, bondholders get income now and priority in the event of bankruptcy proceedings.

by &lt;a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller"&gt;Robert J. Shiller&lt;/a&gt; which suggested in 2000 that the U.S. stock market was overvalued.  And of course, it was.  Dr. Shiller suggests that people overvalue the market (defined by high price to 10 year average earnings ratios), when they think the old rules no longer apply.  For instance, in 1929 people thought new technology, easy credit and popular interest in investing meant that high P/E ratios were sustainable.
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn't take much in the way of mental gymnastics to imagine each of these things being said in 1999.  The Internet, Globalization, and Mutual Funds seemed poised to sustain higher earnings growth than anyone could have imagined 5 or 10 years earlier.  (The book discusses lots of factors that contributed to bubble valuations, but these are the ones I remember having an impact on me -- right at the start of my investment experience.)
&lt;p&gt;
One of the most striking parts of the book, is a graph showing the rise of stock prices and earnings (as represented by the S&amp;P 500 index) over the last 130 years or so.  I've reproduced the figure &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_1.jpg"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.  It shows earnings increasing at a moderate rate and prices jumping all over the place.  Especially interesting are the booms in the 1920s and 1960s followed by busts in the 1930s and 1970s.  From 1982 to 2000 the divergence begins to look especially ludicrous.  It sure looks like prices are headed south, despite the recent drop.
&lt;p&gt;
But there are a couple of problems with this graph.  The tipoff is the scales on the left and the right.  The left (price) goes to $1500[1] and the right (earnings) goes to $600, but there is no indication how those scales were chosen.  Obviously if both lines were on the same scale, earnings would look nearly flat (since earnings are anywhere from 5 to 45 times smaller than prices).  But if we are going to look at different scales, why not pick a scale that matches the range of earnings, say $0 to $55?  One problem, from the point of view of selling the book's premise, is that prices wouldn't look so dramatically high.
&lt;p&gt;
Another issue is that the scale is linear.  Even adjusted for inflation, S&amp;P 500 prices and earnings are several orders of magnitude greater now than they were in 1871.  On a linear scale, a large move percentage-wise is more dramatic when prices are high and muted when prices are low.  If you have a $1000 invested that looses 10%, you're down $100 whether the price per share is $10 or $100.  But if you put both changes on the same linear scale, the drop from $100 to $90 is more dramatic than the drop from $10 to $9.  One way to correct for this illusion is to use a logarithmic scale.  I've used the same data to created &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_2.jpg"&gt;a corrected version of the chart&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not saying that Dr. Shiller is wrong or trying to mislead, but this chart is misleading.  Earnings and prices don't fit on the same scale, but putting them on the same graph suggests a relationship between them.  Implicit in the original graph is the suggestion that P/E ratios should be around 2.5 (since 1500/600 is 2.5).  Using a &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_3.jpg"&gt;linear graph&lt;/a&gt; and letting &lt;a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/mppubs.html#gpaper"&gt;the graphing software&lt;/a&gt; determine the range suggests a P/E ratio of about 27.  (Linear graphs are better for accurately determining absolute values.)  That's skewed by very high ratios in the last few years.
&lt;p&gt;
And this is the frusterating aspect Irrational Exuberance -- it makes a strong case that the market was overpriced in 2000, but it doesn't spend much time discussing the fair value of the market.  The historical average is about 16 which is again skewed by recent history.  I've produced &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/sp500_4.jpg"&gt;another chart assuming a fair P/E ratio of 15.&lt;/a&gt;  Years in which the Earnings line ducks under the Price line (such as 2000) would be years when the market is overvalued.  Maybe this ratio is fair and maybe it isn't.
&lt;p&gt;
A practical question for me, right now, is whether or not the S&amp;P 500 index is overpriced at a P/E of 18.  I think it might be.
&lt;p&gt;

The expected payout would be $500,000 and you could probably sell the chance to some wealthy individual for almost that amount.  Buying the chance for $450,000, for instance would be a $50,000 expected return. In other words for a small price (relatively speaking, of course), you could trade a situation with an extreme range of outcomes for a certain outcome.
&lt;p&gt;
This is an example of a win-win hedge: you get a large sum of money and the other party gets a discounted chance at a large payout.  If the buyer can make this sort of transaction over and over, he'll make a good profit with moderate risk.  This is how casinos and insurance companies work more or less.
&lt;p&gt;
Suppose you decided to keep the chance and sell a chance to win a million dollars on that same coin flip to someone else.  You have an expected return of $500,000 on the first transaction and ($500,000) on the second (plus whatever you sold the chance for).  But there are two possible way for these transactions to pay out.  It all depends on whether or not you make the same guess as the person you sold a chance to.  Here's a chart showing the difference:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
You  | Same | Not 
-----|------|--------------
Win  |   0  |  $1,000,000
Loss |   0  | ($1,000,000)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, if the guesses are the same, it's no different than selling your chance.  But if they are different, the variation of results is huge.  You would risk nothing in the first case and everything on the second.  Statistically speaking, you would say that the results if the guesses are the different have a correlation of 1 and -1 when they are the same.  If the bets were on two coin flips, the correlation in either case would be 0.
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously this is an extreme simplification of what investors are faced with.  I own Raytheon stock and work for Raytheon, but there's not a huge amount of correlation between my job security and my company's performance.  In some ways the election will matter a lot more, since I depend more on the federal budget than on Raytheon itself.  
&lt;p&gt;
Real life is more like betting on hundreds of coin flips and we don't always know how they are going to interact.  Like an insurance company, you have to spread out the risk and buy it at a discount.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109882357179055934/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109882357179055934' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109882357179055934'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109882357179055934'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/10/coin-flip.html' title='A coin flip'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109783284931600778</id><published>2004-10-25T12:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-10-25T12:51:43.006-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CAJ'/><title type='text'>Why I bought Canon</title><content type='html'>Canon is a Japanese manufacturer of cameras, office machines, and machines for building micro-chip and LCD screens.  Chances are good that you use one or more of your products every day.  I have a Canon printer and scanner on my desk, I gave my wife a Canon Rebel a couple years ago and I have a pair of Canon binoculars.  One of the very pleasant surprises I found by reading the financial statements is that HP sells re-branded laser printers made by Canon, which I have used in every office I've worked in.
&lt;p&gt;
Buying a Japanese company (through an &lt;a href="http://www.adr.com/"&gt;ADR&lt;/a&gt;) is a bet on the yen verses the dollar.  Even a good company that becomes more valuable in Tokyo could lose value when translated into dollars.  A strong dollar is bad for people holding stock in foreign companies.  But it is good for companies that export to the US.  Canon records high profits when it makes digital cameras with cheap yen and sells them for strong dollars.  Overall, I hope Canon will be a good hedge against a weakening dollar.
&lt;p&gt;
Japanese companies have a reputation of trying to maximize sales even if it means lower profits, but Canon is an exception.  Since 1994, net profit margins have gone from 1.7% to 8.6% in large part because gross margins have increased from 38.8% to 50.3%.  The company has gone from selling cheap knockoffs of German cameras to setting the standard for optical quality, which people are willing to pay a premium for.
&lt;p&gt;
I bought Canon at $45 in December when the dollar traded at about 105 yen.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109783284931600778/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109783284931600778' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109783284931600778'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109783284931600778'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/10/why-i-bought-canon.html' title='Why I bought Canon'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109609168705675230</id><published>2004-10-14T17:36:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-10-14T17:55:17.623-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>End of the season evaluation of The Trade</title><content type='html'>Well, the season is over and we can take a look at The Trade so far.

I put Brazoban in the plus column for the Dodgers since Mota was blocking him out of playing time.  I think it's pretty clear that Penny's injury and Choi's benching make this deal look pretty bad for the Dodgers.  Encarnacion played better than I expected, but so did Finley.  Florida certainly seemed to get a good deal.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not 100% sure how free-agency works, but I think Finley's future is a win-win for the Dodgers.  They get the first shot at signing him, and if someone else (Arizona for instance) signs him, they get a draft pick or two in compensation.  The ages (and thus potential) and contract situation of the other players involved favor the Dodgers.

It tasted ok, but the loaves looked like albino hockey pucks[1].  Today I made the same recipe, but let the dough rise (and brushed on a little olive oil) and the results were amazing.  There isn't much to the recipe: flour, water, salt, sugar, baking soda and, oh yeah, sourdough starter.  I'm pretty sure the yeast from the starter is the primary source of flavor in this bread.
&lt;p&gt;
Jesus told his disciples to "beware of the yeast of the Pharisees", which is a fairly cryptic statement to most of us today.  The New Testament records many conflicts between Jesus and the Jewish religious establishment, especially the Pharisees.  Only his conversation with Nicodemus and his trip to Jerusalem as a child show anything resembling a friendly relationship.  It's clear that Jesus saw something wrong with the Jewish leadership.
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that the yeast symbolism describes the Pharisees's flaw.  During the Passover, yeast was forbidden to the Jews because they needed to be ready to travel.  Flat breads (like pita and tortillas) are easier to make and carry on the road.  Yeast, like the sourdough starter I use, needs to be cared for and would be a burden to travelers.  Also, because yeast varies with regions, it would preserve a part of the place the Jews had left -- Egypt.  Jews remove every bit of yeast from their homes during the Passover as a reminder of the flight from Egypt.  These days, that mostly involves buying Matza rather than leavened bread, but in the past it meant cultivating a new yeast culture after the feast had finished.
&lt;p&gt;
Yeast is a symbol of contentedness and luxury.  Bread just tastes better with a bit of yeast.  But the yeast puffs up and adds fluff, not substance.  Yeast is a sign of settling down and spreading out.  Jesus said beware, because the temptation is to accept these things.
&lt;p&gt;
This world isn't our home.  We belong to a better and higher country, so we can't be comfortable here.  The yeast of the Pharisees is finding ways around the Sabbath laws, justifying hate and anger, tolerating the abuse of women.  And we are all guilty of it.  We are surrounded by the poor and we create all sorts of excuses so that we can go out to dinner one more time a month rather than helping.  We cheat our employers out of an  hour or two at work since no one will notice.
&lt;p&gt;
Yeast isn't inherently bad, but is dangerous to accept.  Cleaning it out of your life once in a while is an exellent idea because it's just too easy to get used to.

Yesterday a couple of guys in a pickup hit a tree.  The worst accident since we've lived here was a motorcylclist who was killed when he was hit by a car.  My truck has been hit twice just parked on the street, and our neighbor's jeep was also hit while parked.
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the problem is that Orange Grove makes a little s-curve so that it can run a little further north.  Drivers turning left onto south Craig or left onto west Orange Grove can't see cars on that curve until it's too late.  Also drivers speed on both streets.  Craig doesn't look busy, but since it goes under the freeway and past Colorado, it carries a lot of traffic south of Orange Grove.
&lt;p&gt;
I sent a request to the city to put in a traffic signal, which would help matters.  I have some hope, since they did replace the stop signs with signals near the freeway on Craig.  We'll see what happens.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update:&lt;/h3&gt;
Yesterday, less than 8 hours after I submitted a suggestion to through the Pasadena city website, the manager of the traffic engineering department wrote an email telling me a study would be finished around the end of next month.  Apparently, some of my neighbors had already petitioned the City about it.  Talk about a fast response!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109598282262357686/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109598282262357686' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109598282262357686'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109598282262357686'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/09/most-dangerous-intersection-in.html' title='The most dangerous intersection in Pasadena'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109579727305531402</id><published>2004-09-21T13:17:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-09-21T13:07:53.056-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ORCL'/><title type='text'>Short PeopleSoft?</title><content type='html'>It looks like PeopleSoft executives are &lt;a href="http://yahoo.reuters.com/financeQuoteCompanyNewsArticle.jhtml?duid=mtfh77806_2004-09-21_12-17-52_n2110811_newsml"&gt;creating a golden parachute&lt;/a&gt; for when Oracle finally buys the company.  As an Oracle shareholder, this isn't good news, but it's rotten news for PeopleSoft investors.  As this takeover attempt drags on, the odds are Oracle will lower its offer price to reflect increased costs, such as these, and PeopleSoft's decreasing earnings.  
&lt;p&gt;
Which is all to say, I wonder if shorting PeopleSoft (currently at $19.34) would make any sense?  Most of the risk seems to be limited, since the price is currently capped at $21.  If Oracle lowered the total offer by $2.2 billion, that would put it in the $15 range.  If Oracle failed to buy PeopleSoft, I would imagine the price would fall even further.

tenants had left a compost bin and I read about composting at the San 
Diego Zoo.  Joy was happy because it gave us a good excuse to buy fruit 
and vegitables that we knew had a decent chance of going bad before we 
ate them.  Coffee grounds, tea leaves and egg shells are supposed to be 
pretty good compost material, so it fit well with what I consume too.
&lt;p&gt;
On vacation to Idaho this summer, I took some sourdough starter to make 
pancakes and biscuits.  Last Saturday I finally got a decent batch of 
bisuits.  I think the starter might have died off a bit on the way home, 
but now it looks pretty good.  I think I'll consider making bread soon.
&lt;p&gt;
Both of these things harness (or at least theoretically harness) 
organisms that would normally be considered harmful.  Bacteria, worms 
and insects work together to break down the compost material so that I 
can spread it around our garden flowers.  Bacteria and yeast work 
together to break down water and flour so that I can add it to dough to 
make it rise and add a bit of flavor.  It's very satisfying.

At work, we use the Oracle database and I've spent several years learning how to use it.  
&lt;p&gt;
Relational databases are designed based on &lt;a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/"&gt;a mathematical model&lt;/a&gt; invented by E. F. Codd, who was a researcher for IBM at the time.  IBM didn't pursue the idea of relational databases because the assumption was they'd be too slow.  The state of the art at the time were various designs that tried to match the data to the hardware that would be storing and manipulating it.  What Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, attempted was to use the logical model pioneered by Codd to create a relational database.
&lt;p&gt;
It's a truism of computer science that you can't optimize for everything: if you make a program faster, it tends to be harder to change, for instance.  Relational databases optimize for logically ordered data, rather than speed.  But they also turned out to be fast enough, at least for most purposes.  Over the years, Oracle has turned its early leadership in relational databases into huge profits, because there are now many more uses for databases than anyone could have imagined.
&lt;p&gt;
One of those applications, of course, was the internet, which drove Oracle's sales, profits and price to astronomical levels.  So when the bubble popped, speculators panicked, and sold their Oracle shares down to under $8 from a split-adjusted high of  over $46.  It's obvious &lt;a href="http://quotes.fool.com/custom/fool/html-chart.asp?osymb=orcl&amp;osymbols=caj%2Corcl&amp;symbols=caj%2Corcl&amp;currticker=ORCL&amp;time=all&amp;uf=0&amp;compidx=aaaaa%7E0&amp;ma=0&amp;symb=orcl&amp;freq=1dy&amp;lf=1&amp;comp=&amp;type=128&amp;sid=3548"&gt;looking back&lt;/a&gt; that Oracle's price was far out-pacing its value.  At $8 (where I bought my shares), it seemed to me there was plenty of room to grow.  I like using the &lt;a href="http://www.quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=intrinsic&amp;cursym=&amp;csym=ORCL&amp;csym1=&amp;csym2=&amp;initearnec=2%2C681%2C999%2C872&amp;egrrbtn=dd&amp;egrdd=0&amp;egrec=&amp;dcrrbtn=dd&amp;dcrec=15.00&amp;dcrdd=2&amp;passtick=1&amp;p=ORCL"&gt;discounted earnings tool&lt;/a&gt; that Quicken provides.
&lt;p&gt;

home.  We finished painting our bedroom ceiling, installed a new
ceiling fan, pulled off three doors for painting[1], spray-painted a
bookcase, installed a locking doorknob on the bathroom[2], attempted to
install new cabinet hinges in the kitchen[3], replaced the kitchen
light, and made a trip each to Home Depot and Lowe's.  Still on the
on-deck circle are bathroom lights, finishing the various painting
projects and replacing the bathroom outlet.
&lt;p&gt;

Because of the ancient wiring, electrical work is always a bit tricky.
The electrical box in the kitchen didn't work with the new fluorescent
light fixture we bought, but fortunately it included a mounting
bracket that did fit.  After I had finished, the circuit breaker would
trip right away.  I assumed it was a problem with the connections I'd
just done, so I rewired and rewired.  Finally this morning I tested
with the old fixture and discovered that it still tripped.  So I
pulled out the new bracket and everything worked.  The new screws had
made contact with the rat's-nest of wiring stuffed into the box.  In
the end, I pushed around so that the bracket didn't cause a short and
everything worked.  I'm going to have to check the smoke detectors
more often and make sure my renters insurance is up to date.&lt;p&gt;

The result is very pleasing.  Better light helps in almost every way.
Now I wish we had taken some "before" pictures.
&lt;p&gt;

Footnotes: 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  That took longer than you might think thanks to the paint in the
     hinge pins.

&lt;li&gt;  This was harder than it should have been because I had to drill
     more holes in the door so it would take modern locks.

&lt;li&gt;  But failed because the screws were painted over.  Whoever painted
     our kitchen should be &lt;a
     href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/07/new-outlets.html"&gt;tossed

For instance, we bought &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/bike-Bicycles-All-45447-Trek_4500__2000"&gt;mountain bikes&lt;/a&gt; before we were married and talked over all of the various options and choices.  I think our philosophy is that you get what you pay for.  We paid quite a bit more than the minimum for our bikes because we wanted bikes that would last a long time and have minimal problems.  Joy hasn't used her bike much, but I've used mine to ride to work and so on.  I'm very glad we paid extra to save a few pounds and get better components.  I've had very few problems.
&lt;p&gt;
Now Lance Armstrong uses &lt;a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/road/lance_madone59.jsp"&gt;a bike&lt;/a&gt; (or rather several bikes) that is far more expensive with a carbon composite frame and the best components.  Cost is really not a consideration for him, since the Tour de France is on the line and every ounce counts.  But it would be ridiculous for me to buy his bike, since I'm mostly happy with something far less expensive.
&lt;p&gt;
I try to minimize the product of price and problems.  For instance, I bought a cheap pair of binoculars at WalMart that got misaligned almost immediately.  So I replaced them with &lt;a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=129&amp;modelid=7417"&gt;Canon's 8 x 10 WP binoculars&lt;/a&gt; that are more expensive, but are much more durable.  A more expensive pair wouldn't have enough fewer problems to offset the higher price.  In fact, it's possible if I'd bought image stabilizing binoculars I would have had more problems, not fewer.
&lt;p&gt;
There isn't a magic way to find the optimum price point, but there are some rules of thumb:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask an expert for the one or two most important features and focus on those.
&lt;li&gt;Don't pay for features you don't understand or care about.
&lt;li&gt;Don't pay extra for a single, secondary feature.
&lt;li&gt;Lighter, smaller and simpler tend to be undervalued traits.
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, go for the cheap models of a high-end brand.
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the off-brand will make really good models that get overlooked (and undervalued).

Originally it seems that scientists proposed materialism as a sort of approximation.  Since material things can normally be studied profitably without introducing non-material concepts, it turned out to be a very good approximation.  For instance, Galileo was able to observe and study sunspots because he ignored the ancient assertion that heavenly bodies are perfect.  In practice, material objects are measurable and non-material things are only accessible subjectively.
&lt;p&gt;
At some point, people wondered if there might not be anything except material objects.  After all, the approximation was so good that many phenomena were yielding to scientific explanation.  Perhaps, the reasoning goes, non-material things simply do not exist.  Materialists often make exceptions for things like Justice (which is a goal or ideal and does not exist outside of the realm of thought), or scientific laws (which are observable, though not necessarily binding).  But they don't allow for a spiritual world or anything more than a Deist god.
&lt;p&gt;
Arguments from popularity normally exhibit &lt;a href="http://www.fallacyfiles.org/bandwagn.html"&gt;the bandwagon fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, but it is telling that most people have believed in some form of dualism.  It's difficult to understand why dualism should be so deeply ingrained in our intellectual history unless people have some reason to believe it is true.  The materialist explanation seems to be that people have a need to understand the world around them and when they don't understand something (for instance, why the sun rises every morning) they would rather invent an explanation (a sun god) rather than admit they do not understand.  Now that we know how the sun (or rather the earth) moves, we no longer need a sun god.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not really a philosopher, so I won't pretend to be able to refute materialism.  But I do think I can show why we should be skeptical about accepting it at face value.  Materialist reject non-material phenomena because they don't conform to the level of evidence that is needed for material phenomena.  Souls don't exist, since they can't be measured, even indirectly.  Material phenomena that can't be explained by a materialist are meerly considered challenges to be solved by newer theories, better evidence and more study.  In this way, materialism can resist apperant contradictions.
&lt;p&gt;
But why should we think it true?  I can construct a simular philosophy of spiritualism in which the material world does not exist.  All experiences, no matter how vivid, are meerly the result of realistic dreams.  Through meditation, it will be possible to transend the illusion of the material world and assume the true, spiritual form.  Naturally, a materialist would object that this is counter-intuitive  or is unfalsifiable.  But the same arguments may be used against materialism.
&lt;p&gt;
Further, the materialist explination for why dualism entered human belief systems seems unconvincing.  Why did Aristotle believe in the soul?  What was he trying to explain?  </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109368137856872765/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109368137856872765' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109368137856872765'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109368137856872765'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/08/materialism.html' title='Materialism'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109365421495953773</id><published>2004-08-27T17:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-08-27T17:50:14.960-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Christianity of death</title><content type='html'>I ran across &lt;a href="http://www.shmuley.com/index.php?section=article&amp;id=63"&gt;an interesting review of The Passion&lt;/a&gt; by a Jewish rabbi who finds fault with the movie's celebration of Christ's death.  "The Christianity of life concentrates on what Jesus taught his disciples about to how to living virtuously, the Christianity of death distillates the Christian message into the single maxim that Jesus died for mankind’s sins."  I haven't seen the movie, but my impression (and the reason I've avoided it so far) is that the suffering of Christ is portrayed without balancing it with His resurrection.  If Jesus did not conquer death, He would have been a common criminal, not my King.
&lt;p&gt;
But I suppose I am an advocate of the "Christianity of death", because the Christian message really is that Jesus died for mankind's sins.  Obviously Jesus had lots of things to teach us, and I wouldn't for a moment discourage anyone from learning them, but His work was not finished until He had given Himself over to death.  A careful examination of what Jesus actually taught makes me wonder how anyone could expect to live up to His standards.  Hope, for Christians, comes not from His life, but from His death.
&lt;p&gt;
I know why a modern Jewish rabbi would want to find common ground with Christianity, but the same differences that existed between Christians and Jews 2000 years ago are still separating us.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109365421495953773/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109365421495953773' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109365421495953773'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109365421495953773'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/08/christianity-of-death.html' title='Christianity of death'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109354164161666976</id><published>2004-08-25T13:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-08-31T17:24:21.063-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Fish</title><content type='html'>Among the things I thought about on my vacation (while driving through Nevada and such), is that fish are the only predators that I even occasionally eat.  I had sort of assumed that the reason was because the meat of a carnivore tastes bad, but I think it might have more to do with the difficulty in sustaining large populations.  Fish are an exception.
&lt;p&gt;
I had a pretty successful trip in terms of catching fish in large part due to having a high quality rod and reel.  Joy gave them to me as a second anniversary present.  (Thanks, dearest.)  Longer casts and fewer tangles meant that my lure spent more time in the water attracting fish and less time in the air attracting dragonflys.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109354164161666976/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109354164161666976' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109354164161666976'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109354164161666976'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/08/fish.html' title='Fish'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109191640075719190</id><published>2004-08-05T14:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-08-07T15:06:40.756-07:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Hall of Fame voting</title><content type='html'>Since I seem to be on another baseball kick, I've been reading more stuff about baseball statistics.

href="http://gmane.org/"&gt;Gmane&lt;/a&gt;.  Actually Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen,
who rewrote &lt;a href="http://gnus.org/"&gt;Gnus&lt;/a&gt;, did all of the work
and deserves all of the credit. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://gmane.org/plot-rate.php?group=gmane.discuss"

One of my earliest experiences with the internet was when AOL added
newsgroups and mailing lists to their content.  At the time, I
remember being confused because it seemed like two different things
that served the same purpose.  Both required you to "subscribe", both
were for talking with lots of other people and both consisted of
threaded messages.  AOL also had message boards, which are spiritual
ancestors to web boards.  &lt;p&gt;

And of course, they do serve the same purpose.  But since each one
works slightly differently, people develop preferences about which is
better.  For instance, web boards offer the discussion owner the most
control over content and presentation and newsgroups the least.  It's
possible to line them up in a series of spectra: &lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Control:         web  mail news
Ease of setup:   web  mail news
Ease of use:     news mail web
Universality:    web  mail news
Commitment:      mail web  news
Spam prevalence: mail news web
Centrality:      web  news mail
Archive:         web  news mail
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This isn't set in stone of course and there are some subjective
elements to the lists, but you can see how people would have strong
preferences for one or the other of these methods.  I really like
using newsgroups now that I have a good newsreader, which means that
when I come across an interesting mailing list or web board, I have to
decide if I want to endure the pain of reading discussions that
way. &lt;p&gt;

The cool thing about Gmane is that I don't have to decide.  Or at
least there's a chance that I can read a mailing list with my
newsreader.  And if I need or want to use a web browser or search
archives or avoid spam, I've got that too.

noticed how much of his value is on defense, at least by the Win
Shares method.  As of &lt;a href="http://jericson.blogspot.com/2004/07/lo-duca-trade.html"&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt;,
he had 3.4 fielding and 8.9 offensive Win Shares.  I just don't think
of him as being a brilliant catcher.  &lt;p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/wsnlpos/"&gt;The Hardball
Times&lt;/a&gt; has been updated since then but it looks like Lo Duca is
especially strong on the defensive side.  Montreal's Schneider is the
only catcher in the National League who has contributed more on
defense.  In fact, the Win Shares system shows him to be the best
defensive player with (or rather, formally with) the Dodgers.  That's
right, better than Beltre, Cora, Izturis or Bradley.  Which doesn't
seem right.  &lt;p&gt;

I don't really know the answer, but I wonder if this indicates that
catchers get too much credit in the Win Shares system for team
defense.  Bill James created &lt;a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931584036/jonericson-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2"&gt;Win
Shares&lt;/a&gt; in part to help evaluate the defensive contribution players
make to their teams.  He explains it all better than I can in &lt;a
href="http://www.stats.com/store/graphics/EWNS_sample.pdf"&gt;sample
pages&lt;/a&gt; from the book.  Basically a teams wins are multiplied by 3
and divided between offense and defense based on the contribution of
runs scored and runs allowed to the teams wins.  Then defensive shares
are divided between pitchers and position players, and finally between
individual players.  &lt;p&gt;

I really like this top-down approach and I suspect that the system
makes pretty good approximations.  But it is hard to evaluate since
there are so many little details.  For instance, on a team with
several ground-ball pitchers, you can expect more double plays.  So
the system discounts the value of double plays for shortstops and
second basemen on those sorts of teams.  It's logical and fair, but
complicated.  And all of that complication is hidden behind an
innocent little number.  &lt;p&gt;

Evaluating a catcher's defensive contribution is especially
complicated, since the common wisdom going back to the earliest days
of baseball is that the catcher is the defensive leader of a team.  As
a consequence, catchers get more credit for team defense than other
players.  They even get some credit for team pitching, since they
usually help the pitcher decide how to approach the batters they
face.  &lt;p&gt;

Needless to say, the &lt;a
href="http://www.baseballgraphs.com/teams/dodgers.html"&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;
have had exceptional defense over the last few seasons.  So if
catchers are given unfair credit for team defense, it wouldn't be
surprising if Lo Duca is overrated defensively by the Win Shares
method.  On the other hand, if he's as good as the system suggests, we
should see a dip in the Dodger's defense, Florida's defense improved
and Lo Duca's August and September Fielding Win Shares approximate the
first part of the season.  &lt;p&gt;

We'll see.

I'd like to think I've invented the art of cubicle cooking.  (Don't bother doing a Google search.  Somehow the one of the hits was a porn site and the another was about "cooking the books".)  Since I'm making it up, I'm defining cubicle cooking as the art of preparing food in an office environment.  At a minimum, you need a microwave and a source of water.  Hot water and a refrigerator are helpful, but not needed.
&lt;p&gt;
I started cooking at work after Joy got me a &lt;a href="http://www.pamperedchef.biz/joyfulchef?page=products-detail&amp;categoryId=8&amp;productId=250"&gt;Small Micro-Cooker&lt;/a&gt; so that I can heat up ramen noodles.  She uses it to make macaroni and other types of pasta.  The pour spouts and strainer lid are really handy, but just about any microwave-save container should work.
&lt;p&gt;
If you've got a box of macaroni and cheese, you can cook it in the microwave by following the directions.  But it's a hassle to take butter to work.  Instead, I substitute plain yogurt, which is easier to transport.  (This idea originated with a friend who uses sour cream.  Joy uses yogurt instead because it has a bit less fat.)  I really like the sour taste, but I can understand if you don't.
&lt;p&gt;
This week I &lt;a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=47591412&amp;parent_category_rn=5760752&amp;vcat=REI_SEARCH"&gt;brought eggs&lt;/a&gt; to work.  Obviously they improve ramen, but today I added an egg to my oatmeal.  I'm pretty pleased with the result, except I should have used less oatmeal.  Cook the oatmeal first with a bit extra water, add the egg, and poach the egg in the microwave.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109156915958759334/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109156915958759334' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109156915958759334'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109156915958759334'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/08/cubicle-cooking.html' title='Cubicle Cooking'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109137742457136336</id><published>2004-08-01T08:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-08-01T09:24:57.803-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The rest of the trade</title><content type='html'>The Dodgers completed their trades minutes before the trade deadline.  The sent Tom Martin to Atlanta for minor-league pitcher Matt Merricks and Dave Roberts to Boston for a minor-league outfielder, Henri Stanley.  The big trade was aquiring Steve Finley and Brent Mayne from Arizona for minor-league players Koyie Hill, Reggie Abercrombie, and Bill Murphy.  Murphy of course just came over from Florida.  Here are the Win Shares or the Major League players moved yesterday:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Rank  Player         Team   POS    Bat  Pitch Field  Total  ExpWS    WSP  WSAA
459   B Mayne        ARI    C      0.0    0.0   0.5      0      3   .089    -2
512   S Finley       ARI    OF     6.9    0.0   1.8      9     11   .396    -2

 90   D Roberts      LAD    OF     7.4    0.0   1.4      9      7   .621     2
434   T Martin       LAD    P      0.0    1.1   0.0      1      2   .348    -1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the Doders gave up 10 and got 9 Win Shares, plus whatever effect the minor league players will have in the future.  Mayne has been a backup catcher, so presumabely he'll earn more than 0 Win Shares through the rest of the year.  It seems to me that these deals hinge on the long-term prospects of the minor league players gained and lost, but is likely to be evaluated on the Dodgers playoff results.  I wonder if they should have stopped before getting Finley, who is nearing the end of his career.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109137742457136336/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109137742457136336' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109137742457136336'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109137742457136336'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/08/rest-of-trade.html' title='The rest of the trade'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109130061762283494</id><published>2004-07-31T11:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-31T12:03:37.623-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Lo Duca trade</title><content type='html'>Yesterday, the Dodgers traded Paul Lo Duca, Guillermo Mota and Juan Encarnacion to Florida for Hee Seop Choi, Brad Penny and a minor-league pitcher, Bill Murphy.  Using the Win Shares list from &lt;a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/wsnllead/"&gt;The Hardball Times&lt;/a&gt; for this season so far:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Rank  Player         Team   POS    Bat  Pitch Field  Total  ExpWS    WSP  WSAA
 37   G Mota         LAD    P     -0.5    8.5   0.0      8      4  1.082     4

375   J Encarnacion  LAD    OF     6.3    0.0   1.4      8      9   .429    -1

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously Murphy hasn't established any sort of value, but is worth more than nothing.  So the Dodgers gave up 28 to get 21+ Win Shares.  But look at the last column, Win Shares Above Average.  I'm not convinced the statistic is accurate, but I think it tells the story of the trade.  Encarnacion has hurt the Dodgers because he's been taking time away from the other outfielders:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 62   M Bradley      LAD    OF     9.0    0.0   2.8     12      9   .639     3

 97   J Werth        LAD    OF     4.7    0.0   0.5      5      3   .937     2
263   J Grabowski    LAD    OF     3.4    0.0   0.3      4      3   .538     0

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, maybe they should have found a way to trade Green as well.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109130061762283494/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109130061762283494' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109130061762283494'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109130061762283494'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/lo-duca-trade.html' title='Lo Duca trade'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109087876760607411</id><published>2004-07-26T14:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T16:57:25.443-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='SCSS'/><title type='text'>Home improvement weekend</title><content type='html'>This weekend, Joy and I finally started painting our room.  We'd bought the paint months ago, but the task of stripping away the pealing paint and prepping seemed pretty daunting.  On Saturday, we finished stripping paint and applied one coat of primer.  Our room smelled awful and since we had disassembled our &lt;a href="http://www.selectcomfort.com/bedconfigurator/sn5000b.cfm?proc=1"&gt;Select Comfort&lt;/a&gt; bed, Joy and I slept on sleeping bags in the living room.  
&lt;p&gt;
On Sunday we bought another can of primer and a new screen door.  The old screen door had gotten warped and was falling off its hinges.  For some reason, it had been installed in the molding, which is rotting away, rather than the door jam.  We bought a vinyl door that matches the window frames our landlord had installed.  Not only does it look good and require no maintenance, it was also easy to install.  First you mount a bar with the hinges and then you mount the door to the bar.  Easy.
&lt;p&gt;
Then Joy discovered why the previous door as attached to the molding.  There isn't enough of a gap between the main door and the screen door for both to be closed at the same time -- the door knob is too long.  There's no hurry to fix it, because I don't have a big enough drill bit to install the screen door's handle.
&lt;p&gt;
Tool of the week: &lt;a href="http://www.mrlongarm.com/smrtline.html"&gt;paint roller with shield&lt;/a&gt;.  (You'll have to roll down a bit if you follow the link.)  I can't imagine painting a ceiling without it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109087876760607411/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109087876760607411' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109087876760607411'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109087876760607411'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/home-improvement-weekend.html' title='Home improvement weekend'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109065830018506294</id><published>2004-07-24T01:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-24T01:38:20.186-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Late night reading</title><content type='html'>Joy fell asleep just now while I was reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345434854/jonericson-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2"&gt;Raising Cain&lt;/a&gt;.  I just finished the chapter on fathers and sons and now I'm reading about mothers and sons.  Joy fell asleep because she's been chasing down our very active one-year old.
&lt;p&gt;
She's done a great job dealing with Joshua.  As the book points out, mothers and sons start out with the closest of relationships and that often doesn't ever change.  What does change is the way boys and men learn to express their love for their mothers.  Joshua isn't always eager to be held and often pulls away to explore the game cabinet or play with a toy.  Joy has been on the lookout for ways she can help him play safely and strikes a good balance between hovering over him and ignoring him.
&lt;p&gt;
My own mom struck a similar balance.  I remember how hard it was for her to help me fill out applications for the military academies and schools on the other side of the country when I was in high school.  But she let me go and helped get Dave and Doug into the Air Force Academy.  I know that every time I got on the plane headed for Los Angeles, she cried, but I never heard her complain.
&lt;p&gt;
Boys and men have to know that the women in their lives have confidence in our abilities.  I've made enough mistakes in life to know that I need people to help me clean things up.  Freedom to risk failure is a wonderful gift because it communicates trust.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109065830018506294/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109065830018506294' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109065830018506294'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109065830018506294'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/late-night-reading.html' title='Late night reading'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109065667854918599</id><published>2004-07-24T00:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-24T01:11:18.550-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Getting things out</title><content type='html'>Looking back at the things I've written here, I'm stuck by how haphazard they are.

The benchmark for longer-term investing is the S&amp;P 500 index.
&lt;p&gt;
When I first looked at the mutual funds availible to me in my 401(k), only one fund seemed like it might surpass the S&amp;P 500 benchmark -- Fidelity Magellan.  But Peter Lynch was no longer its manager.  With huge amounts of money invested, it began to resemble the S&amp;P 500, but with more expenses.  I decided to watch Magellan's progress and invest in the index fund.  As it turns out, Magellan has "returned" -3.17% annually to the index's -2.04% over the last five years.
&lt;p&gt;
There are three elements in the success and failure of mutual funds to beat their benchmark: 1) investment skill, 2) expenses, and 3) investment domain.  The first and second points are obvious and, in theory, counter-balance.  An index fund requires little to no skill, but minimum expenses.  A managed fund has more expenses, but rewards investors with more gains from investment skill.  In practice, many managed funds fail to beat their benchmark even without accounting for expenses.
&lt;p&gt;
The third point, investment domain, is a description of what sort of securities a fund is allowed to invest in.  Over a long period of time, stocks of small U.S. companies have returned more than government bonds, for instance.  So all other factors being equal, a small cap fund will do better over many years than a government bond fund.
&lt;p&gt;
An S&amp;P 500 index fund has low expenses, will match its benchmark and invests in the 500 largest public companies in the United States.  It may not be exciting, but it has been the bulk of my retirement savings for the last five years.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109057268611644245/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109057268611644245' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109057268611644245'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109057268611644245'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/why-i-buy-sp-500.html' title='Why I buy the S&amp;P 500'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109056955371953398</id><published>2004-07-23T00:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-23T00:59:31.216-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A parable</title><content type='html'>There once was a town with one well and everyone was sick all the time.  Each citizen of this town survived only because there was an abundance of barely edible roots in the area.  No one enjoyed more than a few moments in the day and none slept much at night.
&lt;p&gt;
One day, a certain man from that town discovered a spring far from the town's only well.  He drank from the spring and the next day he felt a little less sick.  So he went to the spring again and felt better still.  Soon he was healthy and going to spring every day.
&lt;p&gt;
This man began to search farther away for food, and he discovered various fruits and grains that tasted better and were more nutritious than the roots near the town.  So he became stronger and more energetic.
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, the people of the town noticed the change in this one man and they began to say to themselves, "Who does he think he is drinking different water and eating different food?  He even is acting differently from us."  
&lt;p&gt;
When the man heard what his neighbors said about him, he became ashamed.  "Come," he said, "let me show you the spring with healthy water and the fruit and grains that make me strong."  And some of the people came and saw.  But others scoffed, "This man is trying to kill us!  We have plenty of food and water right here."
&lt;p&gt;
And the town was divided between those who drank from the spring and those who drank from the well, those who ate roots and those who ate fruits and grains, and those who were sick and those who were healthy and strong.  </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109056955371953398/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109056955371953398' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109056955371953398'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109056955371953398'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/parable.html' title='A parable'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-1090547302043037</id><published>2004-07-22T18:48:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-22T18:48:22.043-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>First TES data!</title><content type='html'>When I got in this morning, I learned we have data from the TES
instrument.  As I mentioned to Joy, I feel great satisfaction getting
this stream of ones and zeros from space.
&lt;p&gt;
Andy had set up a mail filter to send a text message to his phone
every time we get data.  It started going off at 4 in the morning as
the guys on the East Coast started catching up on some non-instrument
data.  We didn't know exactly when the commands would be loaded on the
instrument, so he had to keep checking.
&lt;p&gt;
The actual TES data came through about the same time as the morning
Ground System conference call.  He had the pleasure of being able to
announce that the data was processed moments after someone predicted
it would take 3 hours for the data to arrive.  Total turnaround time
from command execution to fully processed was less than 45 minutes.

Peter Lynch says that if you can't tell a stock's story in a minute then you shouldn't own the stock.
&lt;p&gt;
I've been buying Raytheon stock every other week for the last five years, which means I've seen prices from about $75 to about $18.  Thankfully I've bought shares mostly at the lower end.  Also, I've been dollar-cost averaging into my Raytheon position, so I've bought more shares when the price was low.
&lt;p&gt;
Virtually the only reason I own the stock is because I work for Raytheon which matches my 401(k) contribution with company stock.  I've sold shares as often as I am able, so this investment represents an opinion in the quality of the company's work environment more than in it's ability to make money for it's owners.
&lt;p&gt;
I worked as an intern for Raytheon for four summers and when I got out of UCLA, Raytheon Pasadena offered me a job working with JPL.  I also was offered a job at the same starting salary with a dotcom startup in Santa Monica called &lt;a href="http://www.usinteractive.com/"&gt;US Interactive&lt;/a&gt;.  Despite the possibility of a large IPO, I chose Raytheon.  After an IPO at about $10 on &lt;a href="http://quotes.fool.com/custom/fool/html-historical.asp?osymbols=usitq%2Crtn&amp;symbols=usitq%2Crtn&amp;currticker=USITQ&amp;close_date=8%2F10%2F1999"&gt;August 9, 1999&lt;/a&gt;, USITQ reached a high of $92 on &lt;a href="http://quotes.fool.com/custom/fool/html-historical.asp?osymbols=usitq%2Crtn&amp;symbols=usitq%2Crtn&amp;currticker=USITQ&amp;close_date=1%2F3%2F2000"&gt;January 3, 2000&lt;/a&gt;.  Fortunately I didn't even lookup the ticker at the time.  Over the same time, Raytheon dropped from about $68 to about $25 on news of large "one-time charges" on earnings.
&lt;p&gt;
Raytheon had bought a number of divisions in the 1990s, including the part I work for which was originally a small "Beltway bandit" based in Maryland.  First it was bought by Hughes, which was bought by GM, which sold bits to Raytheon.  Both cars I've owned have been thanks to a GM employees discount I enjoy as a result of this convoluted acquisition path.
&lt;p&gt;
Raytheon also bought parts of Texas Instruments and an engineering operation, and sold off its Amana appliances division.  Not surprisingly, the company had problems integrating all of these businesses.  Only within the last year or so has Raytheon shed most of the baggage of acquisition and focused on its core business.
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't spent much time analyzing the numbers, but I don't think Raytheon is a good value at current prices.  The company has consistently paid out a 20 cent quarterly dividend, which works out to 2.5% yield, but I don't see how earnings can grow.  We might be in a long defense boom cycle because of September 11, but the market has already taken that into account.
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, shares of US Interactive are not even worth the paper they are printed on, and the Santa Monica office has been closed down.  Raytheon hasn't been a great stock, but it's my best investment so far.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109052637040658188/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109052637040658188' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109052637040658188'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109052637040658188'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/why-i-buy-raytheon-stock.html' title='Why I buy Raytheon stock'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109044222318423333</id><published>2004-07-21T12:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-21T13:55:54.170-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Little things</title><content type='html'>I love being a father!  Since Joy came home from The Pampered Chef National Conference in Chicago, I've been feeding Joshua applesauce in the morning instead of Joy breast-feeding him.  He can hardly keep himself from leaping out of his seat while I mix in his vitamins and when I start feeding him, he opens his mouth like a baby bird.  Once he's calmed down a bit (either because he isn't so hungry anymore or he knows I'll continue feeding him), he hums to himself or babbles, "Ma ma ma!"  He likes to lean way over so that there is a shorter distance from the cup to his mouth, and he gently places a hand on my knee.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm pretty certain that for Joshua, "Ma" means "food" and "Da" means "play".  I suppose there isn't all that much else important for him right now.
&lt;p&gt;
He was so worn out from the heat when I got home last night, but he hadn't slept much.  I pulled out his helmet so we could take a ride which seemed really exciting to him.  He enjoys himself on our bike rides, but on the way home he got fussy.  I think he fell asleep for a moment and woke up confused.  Fortunately he calmed down when I got home and we snuggled on the hammock for a while.
&lt;p&gt;
Last night, he woke up a couple of times before Joy and I went to bed.  He practically threw himself on the changing table and back in bed the first time.  The second time I thought he desperately wanted to be held, but he just wanted the sippy cup I was holding for him.  He broke down when I pulled it out of his hands to refill it after he'd sucked it dry.  When he finished drinking, he raced all over our bed trying to stay awake.  He was so entertaining that Joy and I were pretty reluctant to send him to his room.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109044222318423333/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109044222318423333' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109044222318423333'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109044222318423333'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/little-things.html' title='Little things'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109043505947449973</id><published>2004-07-21T11:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-22T15:39:10.646-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Official Aura launch photo</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/1024/aura-launch-poster-s.jpg'&gt;&lt;img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/img/208/1347/400/aura-launch-poster-s.jpg'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the official launch photo of Aura.

Originally there was only an ordinary outlet in the kitchen, so the hole in the tile was too small for the bulky new receptacle. So I had to file away some of the tile and some of the plastic bits on the outlet with my &lt;a href="http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/default.asp"&gt;Leatherman&lt;/a&gt;. Finally I used a one-by-four and a hammer to force it in place. I pity the person who has to replace it -- hopefully they'll tear down the house first. 
&lt;p&gt;
The other outlet in the kitchen was at least has hard. There really ought to be a law against painting screws and the penalty should be harsh. When the screw head got completely mangled, I unscrewed it using the Leatherman's needle-nose pliers. Fun. 
&lt;p&gt; 
I really like screws that have Phillips &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; flat heads.  If I were dictator of the world, I'd require them everywhere.

For instance, when driving, a first-order question is "Am I in immediate danger?" and a second-order question is "Was that my exit?" It only makes sense to look at the second question after you've answered the first. I'm sure we've all seen people who have mixed the order by, say, cutting off a semi in order to get off the freeway. No doubt if you were to ask these people later if they made the right decision, they'd agree that it probably wasn't worth the risk. 
&lt;p&gt; 
Politics is another place this comes up. For months leading up to an election, candidates will say just about anything to get elected. Any chink in their opponents armor is fair game. But once the election is decided, the loser always publicly concedes the election. All of the issues between the candidates were really second-order problems. The answer to the first-order question is that ultimately the people will decide who represents them. Even if you are cynical and believe the loser conceded in order to improve his chances next time, it shows that democracy was the over-riding principle of the election. Starting democracies in places without a strong democractic tradition seems to mostly be a problem of getting everyone to really agree on the first-order issues. 
&lt;p&gt; 
The best time to observe first-order issues is during times of crisis.   For about a month after the September 11&lt;super&gt;th&lt;/super&gt; attacks, most people in America were focused on first-order things (loved-ones, life, patriotism, evil, and so-on). I imagine it was a lot longer in New York. Then as people started to notice that everyone was agreeing that terrorists are evil and firemen are brave, conversations turned to second-order issues like how much money the vitcim's families should get and which administration was most responsible for the intellegence failures.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109027210786580501/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109027210786580501' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109027210786580501'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109027210786580501'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/first-and-second-order.html' title='First and Second order'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109001786948714335</id><published>2004-07-16T15:21:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-19T18:30:25.326-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Mental shortcuts</title><content type='html'>An &lt;a href="http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2004/commentary04071401.htm"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the Motley Fool presented a little puzzle.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
How are the following two rows of the alphabet organized?
&lt;br&gt;
QRUOPSDGJCB
&lt;br&gt;
WETYIAFHKLZXVN
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article gives one answer and points out another interesting fact about the list.  The author, Bill Mann, ended the article by pointing out there is something else interesting about the list.  I was the first person to write back with an answer.
&lt;p&gt;
The trouble is, I had to read the article in order to see the first two facts.  I was completely blinded by the first thing that jumped out at me.  Here's what I wrote:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&gt; Bill Mann points out that there is yet one other noteworthy&lt;br&gt;
&gt; thing about the third list. Can you spot it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It's in QWERTY order.  Whoever typed the list must have worked though 
the keyboard left-to-right and top-to-bottom.  That makes it 
exceptionally easy to spot the missing 'M'.  (Not that I noticed.  I 
was too locked into the order to either solve the puzzle or spot the 
missing letter.)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think I would have eventially spotted the way the rows were sorted, but it would have required more deep thinking than I had time for -- especially since I knew the answer was just a few paragraphs further on in the article.

Until this week that is.  Driving home from Joy's parent's place on Wednesday I ran into some traffic and the neddle on the temperature gauge jumped up near the redline.  I pulled over, added some water, and it just got worse.  So I drove back to Orange.
&lt;p&gt;
When Jim came home, he took a look.  He didn't see any obvious leaks in the radiator, so he had me start it up while he held onto the radiator fan.  It didn't seem like a good idea, but the fan applied almost no resistance.  He even spun it backwards a few times.
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out the fan has a thermal activated cluch, so that it spins faster as the engine warms up.  On older cars the radiator fan is directly coupled to the engine, which is wasteful and loud.  On the other hand, that's one less moving part.
&lt;p&gt;
As long as I kept moving, the air naturally flowed through the radiator.  It helped to turn on the vent and the AC, since that pulled through more air too.  But when I got stuck in traffic, the radiator was worthless without the fan.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/109001446820568432/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=109001446820568432' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109001446820568432'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/109001446820568432'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/radiator-fan-cluch.html' title='Radiator fan cluch'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-109001359394370712</id><published>2004-07-16T14:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-19T17:28:01.286-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>We have liftoff on Aura.</title><content type='html'>Wednesday morning I was asleep while Aura began its (hopefully) six-year mission.

manufacturing &lt;a href="http://www.baseballgloves.com/customgloves/"&gt;customized baseball gloves&lt;/a&gt;.  Rather than going into
Wal-Mart or a sporting goods store and taking a glove that has 80% of
the features you want, you can order a glove that is exactly right.
The manufacturers are happy because it guarantees a sale without
adding much to overhead.  High-end watches would also be a sensible
choice for customization.
&lt;p&gt;
Cell phones, on the other hand, don't make sense to customize at the
factory, since they are difficult to design and compete on price.
Nokia hit on a brilliant solution by selling a phone with replaceable
face-plates.  For a while everyone had the same phone because they
wanted to put Hello Kitty or the American flag on it.  You see the
same phenomenon in cars: everyone has the same GMs and Hondas with big exhaust pipes and extra running lights.
&lt;p&gt;
I'm tempted to say the one sort of customization is sensible and the
other isn't.  After all, a custom glove could make you a better
ballplayer but you won't have better reception if your phone has Homer Simpson on it.  Function versus style.  The trouble is, I don't really act like function matters and style doesn't.
&lt;p&gt;
Exhibit A: &lt;a href="http://geocities.com/jlericson"&gt;my web-page&lt;/a&gt;.  I spent untold hours getting everything
just so, but beyond simple readability customizations, it was all
about style.  (Maybe not &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; style, but style nonetheless.)  Humans
seem to have a need to be different, even if they are different the
same way everyone else is.
&lt;p&gt;
Exhibit B:  I just wasted a bunch more time getting this post to look ok.  It really bugs me to have lines wrap in strange ways.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/108983987711235600/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=108983987711235600' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/108983987711235600'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/108983987711235600'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/mass-customization_108983987711235600.html' title='Mass customization'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-108980047116806720</id><published>2004-07-14T03:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-19T17:27:13.053-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Aura scrubbed again</title><content type='html'>Today I was actually watching the launch on &lt;a href="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/elvnew/mission/vlcc.htm"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt;, which was exciting. About three minutes before the beginning of the launch window, there was an emergency hold. Aura has only a three minute window, since it is intended to fly in formation with Terra and Aqua. There just wasn't enough time to deal with the problem, so the launch was scrubbed for at least 24 hours.
&lt;p&gt;
It sounds like there might be weather issues with a tropical storm in the Pacific. The way I understand things, any delay beyond the 18th would mean we lose the launch site for a while -- to sometime in August.
&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that Joy will back from Chicago tonight, so we might be able to go see it happen at Vandenberg.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/feeds/108980047116806720/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7624682&amp;postID=108980047116806720' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/108980047116806720'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/108980047116806720'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2004/07/aura-scrubbed-again.html' title='Aura scrubbed again'/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-108976210136084317</id><published>2004-07-13T16:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-13T16:41:41.360-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Aura launch delayed again.</title><content type='html'>Aura was &lt;a href="http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d306/status.html"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; just 30 minutes or so before it's launch window closed.

Just surfing the web and I saw this finances...</title><content type='html'>Jon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just surfing the web and I saw this finances section.  If you want to read a good book on the subject there is a book called "The intelligent investor"  I can't remeber who wrote it but it was written in the 1930's i beleave and it was written by a guy who lost it all in the market crash.  The book has been updated for recent times.  One of his basic premises is to buy both stocks and bonds.  When you read the book he explains the purpose but basically bonds are great for a bear market and stocks of course are good for a bull market.  The ratio of stocks to bonds is about 80% stocks (or mutual funds) and 20% bonds.  The idea is that of course you dollar cost average and don't sell even when the market looks bad but you adjust the ratio of stocks to bonds.  Anyway i had a long conversation about the book crosing the pond on the way back from germany awhile back and have been meaning to read the book.  It is not light reading but has pearls of wisdom from an old timer which is something I have read in "The purpose driven life" is a good thing to do, listen to old timers advice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Another sage peice of financial advice In have aquired is thinking about the actual cost of a coke from a coke machine (apply to all bought things in life).  The cost of the average coke is $0.50. This does not figure in other costs such asthe taxes you payed to the government so add about maybe 10 cents to that price.  Next figure in the time value of that coke if you invested it in the market, perhaps over a year it will gain 2 cents.  Now consider that you buy on average about 3 cokes at about $0.50 each during a week.  That total cost to your wallet is about $100 dollars a year that you could put straight into an IRA.

I never did look closely enough at Kaiser Group to know if it was a worthwhile investment apart from the going-private transaction.  No doubt you are correct.  I wanted to sell immediately, even at a small loss, because I wasn't willing to evaluate the company itself and wait for the price to approach the value of the stock.  I imagine this happens fairly often.

I picked Select Comfort independently of the Hidden Gems newsletter and I'm sitting on a large unrealized loss.  But I think for the long term (five plus years), the original analysis will prove more correct than incorrect.  The only piece missing is that Select Comfort turns out to be a cyclical stock, which doesn't work so well with the buy-and-hold approach.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The problem I have with the particular article I'm commenting on is that some of the facts are wrong or given undue weight.  For instance, the fact that Sleep Number, and not Select Comfort, is the brand consumers know seems a totally meaningless criticism.

Unfortunately, due to legislative caps on the size of those loans, FHA-insured loans have become unavailable to Americans who live in areas with high housing costs.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In order to address this problem, H.R.1852 would increase FHA loan limits to 125% of the median home price for high-cost areas and allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to increase that limit by up to $100,0000 based on market conditions or the prices in that area. These increases, along with other changes, would allow many Californians to take advantage of the lower interest rates on loans that meet the standards set by the FHA and open a door to refinancing opportunities for many borrowers currently facing potential foreclosure.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Additionally, H.R.1852 would enable the FHA to use a more flexible risk-based premium pricing structure that would allow the FHA to better serve zero-and-lower-downpayment borrowers, or borrowers with low credit scores.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In addition, H.R.1852 adds new borrower protections, such as increased disclosures and mandatory foreclosure prevention counseling. It also would inflict civil penalties on any party attempting to influence a home appraisal, ensuring that the appraisal process remains fair and unbiased.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I am pleased to report that H.R. 1852 passed the House on September 18, 2007. In the Senate, the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs has approved its own version of the bill, the FHA Modernization Act of 2007, which will be taken up for consideration by the full Senate. While this bill makes important changes to the FHA, it does not increase the loan limits as high as in the House version.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Rest assured I support the goals of H.R.1852 and will fight to see that the higher loan limits are included in either the final Senate version or any bill that comes out of Conference.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again thank you for writing to me.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Barbara Boxer&lt;BR/&gt;United States Senator&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now here's what I think happens: all of Senator Boxer's correspondence is sorted by computer into categories: opposed or for such and such a bill or issue.  Then a canned response is sent back to the sender based on the category the original mail was sorted into.  It's possible an assistant or intern does a quick sanity check on the computer's triage, but that's not likely to be  a very thorough reading.  So my email got sorted in the wrong bin.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Here's my response that is unlikely to do any good:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Actually, I'm opposed to H.R.1852.  Raising FHA loan limits will not solve any problems for ordinary Californians.  In fact, delaying the solution to the real problem (high housing costs) will likely make it worse in the long-run.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If you are keeping statics of constituent input, please register my opposition to this bill.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thank you,&lt;BR/&gt;Jon Ericson&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Somehow, I don't feel democracy is working very well.  I can't imagine there are many lobbyists campaigning for &lt;B&gt;lower&lt;/B&gt; house prices at the moment.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/5077602876018059391/comments/default/6281386804884584590'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/5077602876018059391/comments/default/6281386804884584590'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-letter-to-congress-on-hr-1852.html?showComment=1194378420000#c6281386804884584590' title=''/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-letter-to-congress-on-hr-1852.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5077602876018059391' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5077602876018059391' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-2096058744'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='11:47 AM, November 06, 2007'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-7948674207607610233</id><published>2007-11-13T17:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-13T17:25:59.509-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Today I got a response from Senator Feinstein.

I edited out what looks like an executive summary of the bill:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Dear Mr. Ericson:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thank you for writing to me about legislation on home ownership assistance programs. Your correspondence is important to me and I welcome this opportunity to respond.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Like you, I recognize that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) plays an important role in financing home ownership for those in underserved communities. As the cost of housing in our State is extraordinarily high, such programs are especially necessary. At this time, various bills are pending in Congress relating to this issue.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are several provisions in the "Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007" (H.R. 1752), sponsored by Representative Judy Biggert (R-IL) that are intended to modernize the FHA and expand the financing options available to homebuyers. Specifically, this bill would increase the FHA loan limits from 87 to 100 percent in high cost areas and allow FHA to reduce insurance premiums for borrowers who demonstrate a record of timely mortgage payments. This is intended to help more working families benefit from the FHA Mortgage program. H.R. 1752 has been referred to the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Additionally, the "Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007" (H.R. 1852), sponsored by Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) intends to reform the FHA. This bill would restructure FHA to rely less on large down payments and instead rely on the amount collected from annual payments. While the current FHA mortgage insurance premiums are based on the amount a borrower puts down on the mortgage, H.R. 1852 would allow a borrower's credit score to determine their mortgage insurance premium. This bill would also increase the FHA loan limits from 87 to 100 percent in high cost areas and eliminate the current statutory three percent minimum down payment for first time home buyers. H.R. 1852 was reported out of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services on June 28, 2007. Please know that I appreciate hearing your thoughts regarding this issue and will keep them in mind should these bills or similar legislation come before the full Senate.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again, thank you for writing. I truly value your correspondence. Should you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to contact my Washington, D.C. staff at (202) 224-3841. Best regards.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;BR/&gt;        United States Senator&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/5077602876018059391/comments/default/7948674207607610233'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/5077602876018059391/comments/default/7948674207607610233'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-letter-to-congress-on-hr-1852.html?showComment=1195003500000#c7948674207607610233' title=''/><author><name>Jon Ericson</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07849862226022141727</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1271950705_e29c445a4e_s.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://4of2.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-letter-to-congress-on-hr-1852.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-5077602876018059391' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7624682/posts/default/5077602876018059391' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-2096058744'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='5:25 PM, November 13, 2007'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7624682.post-2000452748988618012</id><published>2007-12-06T06:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-06T06:03:38.700-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Ahh... it is one of those interesting times in inv...</title><content type='html'>Ahh... it is one of those interesting times in investing.

Well. As you mentioned. You can cut the costs of operating a business by controlling the aspects from manufacturing to retailer. &lt;BR/&gt; As for the Select Comfort Corporation. There are some ways that are effective. But that is for another time. Some practices are not as effective or even good business practice. And when any company takes the wrong direction, it is time that tells the story.&lt;BR/&gt; Even though the Company has done tremendous in the past, the stock has plummeted within the last 3years. Yet they are still opening up more stores without the consideration for cannibalization. &lt;BR/&gt; You have your sales workforce accountable for and document every 20 minutes of your workday. (just ask a salesperson) The retail salesperson's task has now been redefined to more of an administrative and telemarketing position. This is diverting their main focus away from customer in the store while they're trying to uphold this new quota. While increasing the workload with these tasks, they are increasing the budgets as well. Most stores can only attain less than 50% of their illusive goals set for them. .. Look at William R. McLaughlin's erroneous growth projections that were not attained. And that will answer the reason for a very low employee moral and a MUCH higher than normal employee turnover. Most other retail organizations would be embarrassed to admit this. But it's even admitted on one of their '06 training videos! Their 'NEW' direction is more focused on this well outdated "Six-Sigma" routine and is micro managing their sales force to extinction. That means the salespeople are being replaced MUCH quicker than the speed of 'normal attrition'. &lt;BR/&gt; The company is focusing on a 'what is wrong with our salespeople' mentality, instead of more appropriately applying the focus on the changing economy. They should be focusing on the current consumer spending style by adaptively seeking out new marketing and pricing solutions. And take more direct involvement and accountability with the salespeople in a pro-active way which they have not done for to many years. They are so disconnected with their "salesforce" that they do not have a clue what they think of the company right now.

I buy it at a pharmacy, local grocery, Wal-Mart....  If I want a Sleep Number bed I have the options of buying sight unseen online or by phone, or going to a Select Comfort store.  As a Select Comfort Sleep Associate, I have had many folks wander into the store and and say something to the efect of "Oh, this is where Sleep Number beds are!"  Yes, they seem genuinely suprised at the discovery.  The company needs to do a better job of tying Sleep Number to Select Comfort, or rename the stores to match what we are to use when answering the phones, Thank you for calling the Sleep Number
