## Ruby Language
# OptionParser

{% raw %}

[OptionParser](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.1.0/OptionParser.html) can be used for parsing command line options from `ARGV`.

---

## Mandatory and optional command line options
It's relatively easy to parse the command line by hand if you aren't looking for anything too complex:

    # Naive error checking
    abort('Usage: ' + $0 + ' site id ...') unless ARGV.length >= 2

    # First item (site) is mandatory
    site = ARGV.shift

    ARGV.each do | id |
      # Do something interesting with each of the ids
    end

But when your options start to get more complicated, you probably will need to use an option parser such as, well, [OptionParser](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.1.0/OptionParser.html):

    require 'optparse'
    
    # The actual options will be stored in this hash
    options = {}

    # Set up the options you are looking for
    optparse = OptionParser.new do |opts|
      opts.banner = "Usage: #{$0} -s NAME id ..."
    
      opts.on("-s", "--site NAME", "Site name") do |s|
        options[:site] = s
      end
    
      opts.on( '-h', '--help', 'Display this screen' ) do
        puts opts
        exit
      end
    end
    
    # The parse! method also removes any options it finds from ARGV.
    optparse.parse!
    
There's also a non-destructive `parse`, but it's a lot less useful if you plan on using the remainder of what's in `ARGV`.

The OptionParser class doesn't have a way to enforce mandatory arguments (such as `--site` in this case). However you can do you own checking after running `parse!`:

    # Slightly more sophisticated error checking
    if options[:site].nil? or ARGV.length == 0
      abort(optparse.help)
    end

For a more generic mandatory option handler, see [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2149183/7948068). In case it isn't clear, all options are optional unless you go out of your way to make them mandatory.

## Default values
With `OptionsParser`, it's really easy to set up default values. Just pre-populate the hash you store the options in:

    options = {
      :directory => ENV['HOME']
    }

When you define the parser, it will overwrite the default if a user provide a value:

    OptionParser.new do |opts|
      opts.on("-d", "--directory HOME", "Directory to use") do |d|
        options[:directory] = d
      end
    end



---

## Long descriptions
Sometimes your description can get rather long. For instance `irb -h` lists on argument that reads:

      --context-mode n  Set n[0-3] to method to create Binding Object,
                        when new workspace was created

It's not immediately clear how to support this. Most solutions require adjusting to make the indentation of the second and following lines align to the first. Fortunately, the `on` method supports multiple description lines by adding them as separate arguments:

      opts.on("--context-mode n",
              "Set n[0-3] to method to create Binding Object,",
              "when new workspace was created") do |n|
        optons[:context_mode] = n
      end

You can add as many description lines as you like to fully explain the option.
