It's happened enough that I don't think it's a coincidence: people
tend to like new ideas better the second time they hear them. Remember
how you felt when you heard Ben Affleck would be playing Batman?
Seemed pretty dumb, right? But then you remembered the
[others actors in the role](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=active&q=batman+played+by)
and that Micheal Keaton succeeded where George Clooney failed. So, you
know, maybe Mr. Affleck will do just fine. Some ideas need to be
acquired incrementally.

Community managers, at least at Stack Overflow, often take the
responsibility of announcing changes and we've noticed people don't
like their

Unfortunately, there's no way to know beforehand if these complaints
are valid or not. They represent a natural knee jerk reflex to any
abrupt change. Truthfully, we often sympathize because we all went
through the very same shock treatment when we first heard the new idea
internally. But we also know that after a week or so the surprise won't
be so troublesome. Like the change Facebook or Twitter recently made
that prompted waves of protests and petitions, changes on Stack
Overflow quickly become the new normal.

Unless they
[just don't work out](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/258048/1438) of
course. Critical feedback works best when it includes specific
problems caused by the change:

> Hmm . . . When I do X, I expect to see Y. Now I'm going to get Z
> instead and that will break my workflow.

We can work with the developers and designers to accommodate the
workflow or provide a workaround. Or failing that, there's a chance to
address shortfall. We pitch ideas to our communities for the very
purpose of getting feedback we hadn't considered yet. Our casual
handicapping of voting on meta leaves plenty of arbitrage
opportunities. Features we think will be met with popular approval hit
strong headwinds. Features we are certain will be unpopular get wide
acceptance. It's uncanny.

I just let slip a major cause for the second post is often better
scored than the first: we don't often follow up when the first post is
well-received or when we are convinced to change course. Let me break
out a logic table to illustrate:

&nbsp;                 | Positive reaction    | Negative reaction
:-----------------     | :-------             | :-------
**We agree**           | No followup          | No followup
**We disagree**        | ???                  | Second post

So the only time we really publish a response to meta is when we think
we have a good idea that folks didn't understand the first time
around. There's a story in
[_Thinking, Fast and Slow_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00555X8OA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00555X8OA&linkCode=as2&tag=jonqui-20&linkId=UAP5WVRSUHYSC3A5)
about how criticism often looks more effective than praise. Daniel Kahneman looked
a the performance of
[IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces) pilots
after receiving a commendation or reprimand. Statistically speaking,
future performance could be explained simply by reversion to the
mean. In other words, commanders tend to praise pilot doing
exceptionally well and, after praising that achievement, notice they
had "lost their edge". Meanwhile, pilots who had a random string of
bad luck would start to look more average not because the commander
yelled at them, but rather as a result of statistical phenomenon.

While it can seem like we consistently screw up initial
communication, it's problably better to say we don't often restate
meta posts when we get the communication right. We only ever write
second posts when we don't get the feedback we want or aren't swayed
by it. And that's a bit of shame now that I think about it. We don't
think of our goal as browbeating our users into submission, but rather
as **building the best products we can with our user's help**.

It bugged me to put `???` in the table above. Here's how the chart
really should look:

&nbsp;              | Positive reaction | Negative reaction
:-----------------  | :-------          | :-------
**Good idea**       | Do it!            | Address concerns
**Bad idea**        | Retraction        | Thanks!

The hard part&mdash;the bottom line&mdash;is being self-critical
enough to recognize when our ideas aren't a good idea. The next
hardest part is admitting publicly that we screwed up, not with the
way we communicted, but in the idea itself. Far too often, we don't
complete the loop on bad ideas even when we recognize them.

I wrote in my review of Stack Exchange's 2015 accomplishments:

The challenge as our company grows and becomes more speciallized is to
continue letting our partners peer over our shoulders as we
work. There's no such thing as too much communication among friends.
