Before I was
[hired by Stack Exchange](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/please-welcome-jon-ericson-community-manager/),

User support, as it turns out, drains me of all energy within
hours. ["Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people"](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/228032106859749377)
need a lot of things and we can't always help. Thankfully, we control
our schedule, so I typically mix answering meta posts, responding to
moderator chat pings, emails and handling user flags between work on
fun stuff like
[new features](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234259/1438) and
[events](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/winter-bash-2014/).

However, one day every week or so was dedicated to answering requests
sent to `team@`. This is part one in a series of posts describing how
we managed to reduce the misery factor while simultaneously
experiencing a 60% increase in ticket volume.

# Prehistory

On August 8, 2008, [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/) began
answering questions sent to `team@`.[^1] As the site grew and as sites
were added, the team got larger.

[^1]:

    I seem to recall an email I sent around then complaining about an
offensive avatar on Stack Overflow.  After getting a reply from Jeff
that the image had been changed, I sent a followup email wondering why
I was still seeing that avatar. The answer, of course:
[caching](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/221414/1438). Unfortunately,
I can't find a copy of that particular email anymore.
