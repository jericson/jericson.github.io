The Biblical Hermeneutics community was [a big reason I stuck with
Stack
Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/42481/the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivation/141021#141021). One
of the draws was having my Christian ideas about the Old Testament
challenged by Jewish scholars who also participated. I learned, for
instance, that Jews prefer to call it the [Hebrew
Scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) since that
doesn't carry Christian theological baggage. Even better, they call
this collection of books the Tanakh, which is a Hebrew acronym for its
three parts:

1. Law (_Torah_) 
2. Prophets (_Nevi'im_)
3. Writings (_Ketuvim_)

There's a lot of history that hasn't been told, but the upshot is the
community was in a constant state of tension between theological
divisions. It wasn't easy but I believed everyone could [live in peace
built on mutual
respect](https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/735/what-kind-of-site-do-we-ultimately-want-to-have). To
the degree the community functioned, it did so based on [the ancient
principle of reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule):

> When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not taunt

> 19:33&ndash;34](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9920/jewish/Chapter-19.htm)

Modern people, at least in the cultural West, have lost faith in this
concept for numerous and varied reasons. To be fair, observing this
saying has been a struggle since the moment it was first
uttered. Given the current state of the world, philosophers and
moralists seem justified in thinking we must be able to do better. If
traditional morality is a sort of evolutionary dead end, perhaps we
should start over with different moral values.

Here's how [Bari Weiss puts
it](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxOcelp9Eh2USn0ddmwZukf5Q0BY-BbxRu?si=sjayjE314NGny7bb):

Taken as a rule of thumb, there's some sense to this. How did the
powerful get power except by stepping on the heads of the powerless?
Barring that, surely the powerless are held back by [cultural
structures](/2015/04/22/cs_females.html) that ought to be torn
down. Taken as an intellectual game, there's some promise there. In
any case, it's an ethical platform on which we can build. For a good
long time I was open to the possibility that new ideology was making
genuine progress.

On Friday September 27, 2019, I wrote this email to an executive[^1] at Stack
Overflow:

I got a response on Sunday saying from the executive saying they
couldn't get involved. I wrote back:

There was a postmortem and it didn't answer as many questions as I'd
hoped. My [one-sided version](/2020/04/03/pronoun_retro.html) might be
the best I'll ever get. 

Reading these emails, I wonder if anything would have been different
if this executive had stepped in after all. Or if I'd sent the email
to more people in order to increase the odds someone would act.  At
the time these emails felt courageous, but re-reading them, I cringe
to see the passive voice and the odd obsession with public
relations. What if I'd been more bold?

After contemplating the situation for many years, I've come to the
conclusion that Monica ran into a wall of injustice veiled in the
language of progressivism. Applying Bari Weiss' framing, Monica was
powerful within the community so her behavior was suspect by
default. The factors I thought were to her favor by the new ideology
didn't seem to matter:

1. [She has vision
   problems](https://www.cellio.org/blog/2019/vision-problems-and-computers)
   which puts her at a disadvantage in the age of screens.
2. She's a woman in technology which means she's [in the
   minority](/2020/06/22/welcoming.html).
3. She's Jewish which puts her in a minority that's been discriminated
   against so often there is a common word for it in English.

The analysis I should have understood was:

1. It's possible the people deciding her fate didn't know about her
   vision. In any case, vision is a problem that can be corrected with
   technology and money.[^2]
2. In the calculus of
   [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)
   transgender people are more marginalized than straight women.
3. What I thought were strong arguments that removing a Jewish
   moderator on the Shabbat before Rosh Hashanah was a bad look,
   turned out to not matter. I can't prove it, but I suspect it's the
   result of subtle antisemitism that comes from observing that Jews
   tend to be successful in certain fields. Jew might be a minority,
   but they aren't _under-represented_ so paradoxically that must mean
   they are among the powerful.
   
I'm not an expert on these things and so I operated under the naive
assumption that progressive ideology was working toward the goal of
treating people as if we were [all created
equal](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript#:~:text=We%20hold%20these%20truths%20to,their%20just%20powers%20from%20the). But
the standard tools of the new morality are
[ineffective](/2023/10/18/unconscious_bias.html). Instead, the logical
conclusion of the new ideology appears to require mistreating people
who don't conform to its evolving standards. As C. S. Lewis wrote:

## Community must be ruled by mutual respect

Last week I [relaunched my community consulting
businsess](/2023/11/14/building_civitas.html). My [services
include](https://buildcivitas.com/services/) updating community rules
and moderation strategy. When I write [such
rules](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/guidelines), they are
built on the foundation of respect. So how would my version of
community rules handle someone [refusing to use preferred
pronouns](/2020/10/18/TL_pronouns.html)?

Framed as a matter of respect, it's clearly wrong to deliberately use
pronouns other than the ones a person requests. But it's also clearly
wrong to require other people to say (or believe) something they don't
agree with. In those situations the attitude should be "I respect your
right to be wrong." That includes wrong beliefs about identity.

Sometimes people can't agree and find themselves in chronic
conflict. In that case, [the answer is to
disengage](/2020/09/24/ignoring_others.html). That might mean changing
the subject or [finding a better
venue](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/politics-discussion-group/3617248)
for a conversation. There's no topic that's so important that it must
be discussed always and everywhere. People matter more ideas. And
here's the thing: treating others with respect means **caring for
people as individuals** rather than as stand-ins for their identities.

[^1]: I'm going to be a bit cagey about naming people here. Everyone
    involved has left the company and there's not a whole lot of good
    to be done by calling them out. 

[^2]: This, of course, is a simplification. I've had perfect vision
    all my life and in the last few years I've noticed my vision
    getting worse&mdash;especially when reading. I can work around the
    problem with low-magnification glasses or making the text on my
    Kindle larger, but even minor vision problems make the digital
    life harder. Monica has much more severe vision problems.
