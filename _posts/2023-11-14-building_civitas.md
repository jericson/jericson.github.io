One of the reasons I started this blog was to help me understand
things by writing about them. Text is fossilized thought, so the act
of setting ideas to words ought to involve learning. Normally, I'm
learning around the edge of what I write. I already know [how to use
`index(match())`](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/replace-vlookup-with-index-match/227),
so my goal in writing about it is to help others (including future me)
get that knowledge too. But this post is about something I'm motivated
to learn quickly.

As of Friday, [I'm no longer Head of Community at College
Confidential](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-cc-s-new-head-of-community-cc-sorin/3650152). That
means I need to find some way to replace that income and stay busy. I
might end up getting a full-time job somewhere else, but since my wife
has medical, dental and other benefits covered, this seems like a good
time to revive my online community consultancy.

## (Re-)introducing Civitas

Sorin (my friend who is now Head of Community) and I started Civitas
while [I was working at EDB](/2022/06/13/year_at_edb.html). We wanted
to continue working together and keep our community building skills
current. We talked to several potential clients and landed one who
wanted to feel out building a community from scratch. Then we got
hired by College Confidential and stopped looking for clients. 

I explained in a post introducing our company that ["Civitas" means a
type of citizenship money can't
buy](https://buildcivitas.com/building-civitas/). We picked that name
because it signifies the sort of communities we wanted to
build. Lately I've been calling them [community
platforms](/2023/11/04/platform_building_so.html). To the extent
anyone knows how to make that happen, I do.

Finding clients and selling my services is not something I know how to
do, however. It would be safest for me to find a large, stable company
and get a decent, well-paid job. That's not what I want, though. What
I want is to work with half-a-dozen mid-sized communities. To do that,
I need to be a contractor. I think the [economics are
right](https://buildcivitas.com/why-hire-consultants/) and the barrier
will be [making connections](/2022/05/23/community_product.html) with
the people who need my services.

As always I start by writing:

* I wrote a [new post on my long-dormant business
  site](https://buildcivitas.com/why-hire-consultants/).
* I started [editing a book](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/writing-a-book/225).[^1]
* I updated [my resume](/resume).
* And I'm writing this post.

Then I posted to social media:
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7129680316419489793/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jlericson/posts/pfbid08R71rm3oVnq2Rc3i3s9zKs5qd7TooVhFX12LuJjsarRR8oXrigD91samfzr1KkXrl),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlericson/status/1723915896710897762)
and even
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@jericson/111401279255445117). Likely
none of these will produce leads, so I'll be trying some
community-manger-specific places that I found [a couple of years
ago](/2021/04/23/job_hunting.html). I'm also emailing and messaging
people who might need my services.

## Surprisingly mundane details that might matter

When I wrote the first email pitch my business, I realized I didn't
have an email signature. That's because I don't care for them. But it
does help to have something to identify the random person who sent the
email. Since I'm contacting people out of the blue, I guess a
signature is necessary:

> [Build a community with me!](https://buildcivitas)  
> [Schedule an appointment](https://calendar.app.google/2fYmo3tSxJvAuRvh9) to talk about internet communities.  
> Visit [my blog](https://jlericson.com/).  
> <img src="https://buildcivitas.com/assets/images/LogoTeal.png" height="72" alt="CIVITAS logo">

I added comments that are hosted on [my Discourse
instance](https://meta.jlericson.com/). Will that matter? I don't know
but it seems odd to claim to be an expert at internet communities and
not have comments.

I run a few ads on Discourse for my blog and [my Ko-fi
profile](https://ko-fi.com/jericson). Today I added an ad for
Civitas. Why not? Maybe it'll bring me a client.

[My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonericson/) tends
toward neglect, which isn't great since people do look at it when they
are evaluating people who they might want to go into business
with. While I was there I added a [Let's
meet!](https://calendar.app.google/2fYmo3tSxJvAuRvh9) button that
takes people to a page they can schedule time on my Google
calendar. Why not add more ways to contact me?

Generally I'm looking at other consultant's websites and profiles to
<strike>steal</strike> take inspiration. Marketing myself comes easier
when I imagine Civitas not as a one-man shop, but as a consulting
business I work for.

These are [low-hanging fruit](/2023/06/02/easy_answers.html) in the
sense that I can do them today. Still, they aren't going to be the
difference maker in any real sense. If I'm still tweaking the colors
on my company website in a month or two, I should be giving up on this
project.

## Playing the odds

In one of my tabs is a spreadsheet called "Job leads". It has 7 rows,
not including the headers. I've contacted two so far and I'm trying to
find the right person to contact on the rest. If I get work from one
of these leads, that seems like a good percentage. Let's be clear:
these first seven are my _best_ leads. From here on out my odds get
worse.

If these leads become contracts, I'll be able to shift to what I do
best: building up communities. The hope from there is that happy
clients recommend me to other organizations that need help with their
communities. From then on I'm playing on the field of my own choosing.

[^1]: Technically I started this before I knew I needed to find more
    work. I've edited one chapter-ish so far and that work is going to
    be dormant for the immediate future.
