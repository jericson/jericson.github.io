 On my Mac, this game gets stuck on a black screen at launch. I've seen a workaround for Linux, but it didn't work immediately for me. So I gave up trying to fix it. In any case, there's no reason the developer shouldn't patch the game since it's advertised for Mac.
 

 

 If this gets fixed (or if I end up playing on WIndows), I'll update this review.
