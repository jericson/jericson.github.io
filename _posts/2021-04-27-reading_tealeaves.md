Stack Overflow's CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, wrote a blog post called [Accelerating Stack
Overflow’s
transformation](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/26/accelerating-stack-overflows-transformation/). It's
written for investors (more in a bit), but if you read between the
lines I think there are some message for the Stack Exchange/Stack
Overflow communities too. 

Before I dive in, I should make clear that community relations at
Stack Overflow have made a turn for the better. I've been critical of
the company in the past because of the tremendous potential it has
(and had). Lately I've been seeing signs the company has truly
refocused on the community. For instance, there was recently [a blog
post about
badges](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/12/stack-overflow-badges-explained/)!
I mean, [it's been a topic in the
past](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/06/18/adios-to-unfriendly-badges-ahoy-lifejacket-and-lifeboat/),
but there's a new emphasis including [calling out new Lifeboat badges
in the
podcast](https://the-stack-overflow-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/how-to-build-and-maintain-online-communities/transcript/)[^1]
and [calling out badges on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow/status/1385866254653796352).[^2]
Badges [used to have top
billing](https://web.archive.org/web/20150401024749/http://stackoverflow.com/)
on the site, but they were demoted to [a link on the help
page](https://stackoverflow.com/help) at some point, which showed a
fundamental misunderstanding of the community.

We can never go back to the golden years of Stack Exchange and we
probably don't want that anyway. Healthy communities change over time
and while I miss the past, I'll always have the memories. What's
important is whether or not the keepers of community will be able to
do their work within the company. Let's see if we can find any clues
starting with the post title.

## "Accelerating Stack Overflow’s transformation"

This might seem odd until you understand the intended audience:
investors. It's been over a decade since the [first round of
financing](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/05/04/announcing-our-series-a/). At
this point, private equity has invested [more than $150
million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stack-overflow/company_financials). It's
about time to find an exit strategy. 

So the transformation Prashanth is talking about here is a _revenue
model_ transformation. When Stack Overflow exited beta and it was
clear there was an audience for this the community's content, the
founders [added
ads](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/03/25/responsible-advertising-feed-a-programmer/). From
what I can tell, this has been a very predictable business. Briefly,
the company [sold Stack Exchange as a
service](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/04/13/changes-to-stack-exchange/). Then
it pivoted to [job
listings](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/23/careers-2-0-launches/). Now
it's [returning to a software service
model](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/07/an-update-on-our-product-led-saas-transformation/). As
[Shog9 noted](https://twitter.com/shog9/status/1379873939384627205)
that announcement probably means the Stack Overflow Talent business will
be shut down.

> We just closed out the first quarter of 2021, and thanks to the hard
> work of Stackers across the board, we surpassed our most optimistic
> financial projections.

As an aside, "Stackers" is a fairly new [term for Stack Overflow
employees](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/40353/stack-exchange-glossary-dictionary-of-commonly-used-terms/256420#256420). I
don't know that I heard it before Prashanth became CEO. He _loves_
that way of designating employees. At the last meetup I attended, he
started a talk by saying something like "Welcome fellow Stackers!"
Only he said "Rackers" instead. That's the term [Rackspace employees
use for themselves](https://www.rackspace.com/blog/racker-culture) and
[Prashanth was previously among their
number](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchandrasekar/).

Investors want to hear about growth. Not all investors, of course, but
the sort of investors who are interested in companies like Stack
Overflow want growth. Since it's privately held, the company doesn't
need (or want) to divulge financial information such as revenue
growth, so you kinda gotta take them at their word. Business is
growing faster then anticipated.

In English: "we're focusing on **improving our product** and **making
money** so that we can pay people to keep the lights
on". That's... hopefully not new. But "product-led" is [a new
buzzword](https://productled.com/) that emphasizes the freemium
model. It's a model that goes back to
[shareware](https://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2009/03/shareware-is-dead-long-live-shareware.html)
and [free
samples](https://www.2dadswithbaggage.com/free-sample-at-sees-candy/). It's
also the same model as Slack, GitHub, Dropbox and a host of other
services.

Will it work for Stack Overflow? Well, the blog post strongly implies
that it's already working. But notice the better-than-expected Q1
mostly happened _before_ opening the Teams product to 50 people teams
for free. The proof will come weeks and months in the future when
companies decide whether to spend on internal Q&A. My guess is there
will be some lost revenue from small companies that no longer need to
pay, but if a few larger companies test the product it could be worth
it.

These were goals for the Talent business too. Unfortunately customers
didn't renew at a high rate. Perhaps the product didn't work as well
as recruiters hoped. Maybe companies were able to hire the people they
wanted without the service. Either way, Talent wasn't reliable. Teams
has a [customer
lock-in](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/05/12/strategy-letter-i-ben-and-jerrys-vs-amazon/)
advantage _if and only if_ people ask and answer a lot of
questions. So the **improve the product** piece is doubly important.

I hate to quote so much, but this paragraph has a lot of important
clues. "Make a difficult decision" usually means "fire some
people". But who? At first I thought it was the Advertising folks. A
more careful reading suggests this merely formalizes the elimination
of the Talent business. Instead, Stack Overflow will position
advertising as a way for companies to promote both their products and
their perks for potential employees. 

So this simplifies the products Stack Overflow sells by offering just
advertisements to solve the problem of developers being aware of what
companies sell and what they are trying to hire for. Brand recognition
is one of the few things that made a positive impact when [I was
scouring job listings](/2021/04/23/job_hunting.html). Seems like
recruiters might be willing to pay to increase awareness so that when
people see their LinkedIn ads they will take a second look.

Later on the post calls this a "high growth" business. There few ways
to grow advertising revenue:

1. Increase pageviews.
2. Increase the number of ads displayed on the page. (This includes rotating ad units.)
3. Increase price per impression ([CPM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpm.asp)).

I don't have access to Stack Overflow's traffic numbers, but anonymous
feedback is a reasonable proxy:

[![Anonymous votes by year](/images/SO_anon_votes.png)](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1402103/anonymous-feedback-over-time#graph)

That shows ~5% growth in 2020. [Voting by active
members](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1402111/votes-per-year#graph)
is flat. Either way, that's not what I'd call "high growth". There
might be more ad units once the slots used for job listings are freed
up, but presumably the revenue gained would be roughly balanced by
what was lost selling the job listing. So the only way I can picture
revenue growth from increasing the price charged.

I ran across an ad that seems to be selling the idea of working for a
company rather than the company's products:

![Ad for Apple jobs](/images/apple_jobs.png)

Clicking through takes me to
https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/shared-values.html, which promotes
Apple's values as a reason to work there.. Everybody knows Apple's
products. Not every developer has a clear idea of whether Apple is a
good place to work. Presumably this sort of promotion will help Apple
recruit the people it wants to hire.

I've
[argued](/2018/05/23/how-stack-overflow-for-teams-fits-into-the-community.html)
that by focusing more on Teams and Enterprise, Stack Overflow will
have incentives to improve the public sites as well. For the sake of
the community, I'd choose ads over Jobs/Talent because pageviews
depend on a healthy community to generate content. If I understand the
end result of this transformation, it will result in fewer
distractions from improving the Stack Overflow platform.

## What happens after a potential exit?

At this point there are only two viable exit strategies:

1. Getting bought by another company (probably Microsoft)
2. Initial public offering (IPO)

Stack Overflow's investors want to get back their investments plus a
healthy return. Let's say each investor wants at least 20% return on
their investment per year. Thanks to the power of [compound
interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Continuous_compounding),
it's easy to calculate an expected value for each investment:

| Series | Date             | Duration | Raised | Expected current value |
| :----- | ----------:      | -------: | -----: | ---------------------: |
| A      | May 4, 2010      | 11 years |    $6M |                   $54M |
| B      | March 8, 2011    | 10 years |   $12M |                   $89M |
| C      | June 1, 2012     |  8 years |   $10M |                   $50M |
| D      | January 20, 2015 |  6 years |   $40M |                  $133M |
| E      | July 28, 2020    | 9 months |   $85M |                   $99M |
| Total  |                  |          |  $153M |                  $425M |

That means that either some other business or the stock market would
need to value Stack Overflow somewhere in the region of half a billion
dollars. For the market, that means either earnings that exceed the
expected rate of return or growth in revenue. So if you are aiming for
11% and the company is paying an 11% dividend,[^3] you don't need much
growth. If, however, the company is losing money now, you'll want to
see a very large growth rate with the idea that you'll [make up for it
in volume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KodqIPMbyUg). Since the
blog post makes a big deal about revenue growth, it's likely earnings
aren't (yet?) high enough for a successful IPO.

Companies that want to acquire Stack Overflow might not be quite so
concerned about an exceptional return on their investment. Microsoft,
in particular, [bought
GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft)
less for it's earning potential and more for access to the developers
who use it. Stack Overflow has a very similar profile in that it's a
service nearly every programmer is familiar with and passively use. So
the good news for existing investors is that companies like Microsoft
value Stack Overflow for more than its earnings potential. The bad
news is there aren't many buyers willing and able to drive up the
price.

Odds are Stack Overflow and Microsoft have already talked price. The
VCs want a bit more than Microsoft is willing pay. So the company
needs to start making it's case for a public offering. The only story
that will sell is growth&mdash;ideally "hyper growth". To reach that
blessed state, Stack Overflow will push Teams as hard as it [can get
away
with](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/406812/why-do-i-see-this-annoying-teams-banner/406823#406823). Whether
this continues after the "liquidity event" depends entirely on what
the new owners value.

## Does Microsoft need Stack Overflow?

In my opinion, Microsoft would be an ideal owner for Stack Overflow
and Stack Exchange communities. They've allowed GitHub to keep being
GitHub and I don't see why they wouldn't embrace the entire
network.[^5] But Microsoft already has [a Q&A
platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/articles/25922/microsoft-qa-top-features.html).[^4]
So why would it want Stack Overflow? For the same reason it wanted
GitHub even though it [already had a similar
product](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-team-foundation-server).

I don't see Microsoft _ever_ competing with Stack Overflow's massive
network effect advantage.[^6] Buying the company would give it unique
access to millions of developers. And who knows? It might even connect
Stack Overflow to LinkedIn somehow.

    note](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/16/podcast-330-how-to-build-and-maintain-online-communities-from-gaming-to-open-source/).

[^2]: But using silver for [a gold
    badge](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/28/famous-question)
    in the graphics for some reason. Of the three badge Tweets I saw, just
    one of them used the right color.

[^3]: Not exactly a realistic example. An 11% dividend probably means
    a substantial dividend reduction in the future because the
    business has gone south and the stock price has dropped.

[^4]: It also has a [Teams
    product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). 
    `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

[^5]: Especially the [Minecraft
    site](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/tags).

[^6]: I know several people at Microsoft building that platform and
    they do good work. But it won't be enough. I know people working
    on [Codidact](https://codidact.com/) and
    [TopAnswers](https://topanswers.xyz/) too. Amazing talent and lots
    of interesting ideas, but I don't think it'll be enough either. Why?
    Because Stack Exchange has an enormous head start and many points
    of stealth lock-in. That said, I'm not sure any of these projects
    necessarily intend to compete directly with Stack Overflow, however.
