Well, the [Stack Overflow strike is
over](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392032/moderation-strike-conclusion-and-the-way-forward). Since
I've been [writing about the strike](/tag/strike.html) quite a bit, I
should probably write some sort of conclusion. Like any good
negotiation, both sides got some, but not all, of what they wanted:

* The moderators got the policy allowing AI-generated posts reversed
  along with some assurance that they will have input in future policy
  changes.
  
* Stack Exchange got volunteer moderators to return to moderating and
  retained flexibility when it comes to making policy changes in the
  future.

This might not seem like much of an accomplishment, but everyone who
was involved in the negotiation deserves considerable credit for this
outcome. In some ways the details matter less than the process. When
my wife and I were first married we quickly discovered we were in
conflict far more often than either of us expected. We ended up in
couples counseling which helped us learn valuable active listening
skills. Our momentary conflicts faded into oblivion, but the process
of overcoming them keeps our marriage alive. As my sixth grade
teacher, Mr. King, told us:

> Knowledge is what remains when what is learned has been forgotten.

One hopes the model for conflict resolution in the future won't be a
moderator strike, but rather the sort of open communication the
parties agreed upon. I generally trust community managers and
moderators to communicate effectively and the way the strike was
resolved shows this trust is well-earned.

Unfortunately, there are a few other parties involved. I'm reminded of
[a Twitter
thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1218709503379525632) I
wrote shortly after [Shog9 and Robert Cartaino were
fired](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342039/firing-community-managers-stack-exchange-is-not-interested-in-cooperating-with). Since
I can't edit Twitter, I figured I take this opportunity to quote
myself and fix a typo or two along the way:

It's odd how much of that thread would work for the current
situation. I'm convinced that the policy that effectively allowed
ChatGPT content came [straight from the
top](/2023/07/26/not_understanding.html) in order to avoid muddying
the waters about Stack Overflow's enthusiasm for AI. It wasn't
calculated to cause a strike. Rather the strike was a small price to
pay for making the message to rest of the industry clear. The [misstep
with the data dump](/2023/06/19/data_dump.html) was an unfortunate
coincidence and quickly rectified. As soon as the big announcement is
over, the community team was freed to implement a reasonable policy.
