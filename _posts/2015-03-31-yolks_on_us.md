It's not even April 1 in my timezone and I'm already sick of April Fools' Day.

This year, our developers came up with a
[Tamagotchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi)-like game for
our users to play. It's called
[StackEgg](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/289032/whats-stackegg). Users
vote on a
[Twitch Plays _PokÃ©mon_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon)
sort of way. Because of timezones, the game started before I woke up
and we'd already DDoSed ourselves:

Thankfully our developers had that problem solved before I had brewed
my morning coffee. But the fun
[didn't stop there](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/252393/1438):

If you haven't used our sites, this might be unintelligible. The
back-story is that early in Stack Overflow's history people decided
that it was supposed to be about _serious coding
questions_. Traditionally, programmer forums (or at least the ones I
used) sprinkled in fun posts such as challenges to write a program to
solve a particular problem in as few characters of code as
possible. This game is called Code Golf or sometimes Perl Golf after
the language which kicked off the earliest events.

Typically, there's no practical advantage to writing short code. In
fact the winning examples often use (and misuse) obscure features to
eliminate characters. Reading winning code golf entries tends to be
challenging even for experienced programmers. Writing production code
in this way won't win you many friends.

Meanwhile, _another_ type of request common on programming forums,
code reviews, were deemed inappropriate for Stack Overflow. This is
where you start with some working code and ask experienced programmers
to look over it for style and clarity problems. The results of a
successful code review are just about as far as possible from the
results of code golf. When Stack Exchange expanded beyond Stack
Overflow, two sites were created nearly simultaneously:
[Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) and
[Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

So fast forward to this morning: a few Code Golf users noticed that
our [Stackagotchi](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/252379/1438) game
allowed people to reset their progress if their pet site was doomed to
failure. They also noticed that the game didn't require anything to
play other than an account. Being a clever bunch of programmers, they
decided to use that bit of information to
[win the game](http://meta.stackexchange.com/stackegg/leaderboard) by
resetting rival sites' progress.

Unfortunately, they decided to "raid" Code Review.

Now I don't think this was a malicious decision; it's clear from
reading later comments that Code Golf folks thought raiding was part
of the game.  There's long been a friendly rivalry between the two
sites, but they weren't the first target. However, when Code Review
got targeted, it set up a
"[Toxoplasma of Rage](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/)". Code
Review users were understandably annoyed that their game was being
interfered with. And Code Golf people were annoyed that Code Review
people were taking the situation so seriously. Which only annoyed the
Code Review people even more.

It turns out the reset function was _not_ designed for raiding. One of
our brainstorming ideas was to set up battles between sites after
their Stackagotchi had matured. But that idea fell by the wayside as
the deadline approached. We gave users a network leaderboard, but no
other way for sites to interact. In retrospect, it was inevitable that
the raiding strategy would develop. What's surprising was how
_quickly_ Code Review discovered it.

Thankfully, the controversy has mostly blown over already. As far as I
can tell, the treatment regimen was good, old-fashioned
communication. The people doing the raiding have more or less stopped
now that they understand how folks on other sites felt about the
strategy. And I, for one, gained a greater appreciation of the clever
users of Code Golf. They aren't evil at all; just misunderstood.

So maybe today hasn't been so bad after all.
