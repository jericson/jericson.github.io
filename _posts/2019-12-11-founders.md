There's an unauthorized biographic movie of Ray Kroc called
[_The Founder_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Founder) which
tells the story of how he took over the McDonald's brand from Mac and
Dick McDonald. While the filmmakeers strongly imply that Mr. Kroc
stole the title of founder of McDonald's, I couldn't shake[^1] the feeling
that he had as much right to it as the McDonald brothers.

In my experience, every large organization goes through two distinct
stages in its history that I call:

1. Coalescing and
2. Scaling.

For McDonald's, the first step occurred when two brothers finally hit
on a successful business by observing their customers and creating a
process to serve them. If you've seen the movie, it was visually
represented by chalk outlines on a tennis court:

They attempted the second stage by selling franchises, but were not
able to maintain the qualities that make McDonald's McDonald's. Enter
Ray Kroc who, whatever his faults, did scale from 6 franchises that
shared little more than a name into a global organization[^2] where
each franchise is clearly a McDonald's:

Organizations also go through periods of re-entrenchment, which is a
variation of coalescing, when scaling fails for one reason or
another.[^3] More often than not, organizations don't ever reacquire
membership once they lose it. Successful scaling is considerably more
challenging than most people realize. Not only do you need to provide
consistent training to integrate new members, you also have to deal
with cultural challenges from unreached people
groups. [For McDonald's that meant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_McDonald%27s#1990s):

* Kosher kitchens in Israel,
* Halal menus in Muslim countries and
* Maharaja Macs made with lamb in India.

Ray Kroc set the stage for this sort of scale by purchasing the
company away from the McDonald brothers so that he could make changes
to the original blueprint to serve customers outside of Southern
California. And yet, the original McDonald's vision (many customers
served at low cost) shines through. That's a true accomplishment.

Some organizations don't want to scale. There's nothing wrong with
that. I've been involved in dozens of groups that start off with a
handful of members and never grow. Scaling is risky, so why bother if
there's no compelling reason to do so?

There's really only one risk: **loss of the original purpose of the
group**. That's it. If you try to scale, but it doesn't work out, the
future of the group depends only on whether it has held onto its
founding principles. Unfortunately, **getting bigger always requires
compromise**. That's the tension and that's why so many organizations
fall apart when they bump against some limit to growth. Instead of
coalescing again, they make more compromises to try to grow again.

The brilliance of Ray Kroc is he created a company that holds onto
its founding principle while still bringing in more franchises and
more customers.

[^1]: One of the points of contention between Kroc and the McDonalds
    in the movie was whether to sell real milkshakes or Instamix
    milkshake mix. Turns out that's
    [artistic license](https://rayandjoan.com/the-founder/).

[^2]: A title card noted a commonly-cited statistic:
    ["McDonald's feeds . . . about 1 percent of the world's population."](https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/04/30/13-Disturbing-Facts-About-McDonalds)
    I suspect the filmmakers expected us to be horrified by this, but
    I'm astounded. Surely feeding people is a _good thing_.

[^3]: For instance, I was a part of a fraternity that went from a
    membership in the 30s to half-a-dozen and back to double
    digits. Mostly that was a result of the timing of graduations
    followed by a renewed sense of purpose. There were built-in limits
    to the size of the fraternity such as the size of our house and
    the organizational structure.
