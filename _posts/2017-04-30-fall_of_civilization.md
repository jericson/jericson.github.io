 This is an early access game and it really shows. The good news is the developer really is working to fix bugs and improve the game. (A previous version of this review pointed out a few technical problems that were resolved in

 It's still too early to say how this game will be on release, but it shows promise as a post-apocalyptic tribal strategy game. I do wonder if it might benefit from some sort of fog of war system that would hide the movement of other tribes. For one thing, it would make exploration more interesting. For another, I get bored watching the turn play out on distant parts of the map I won't be visiting anytime soon.
 

 

 For the moment, I'm giving this a very tentative recommendation if you are interested in the theme and don't mind waiting for the game to develop.
