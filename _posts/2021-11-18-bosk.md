For a game about falling leaves,
[Bosk](https://floodgate.games/products/bosk) is surprisingly
tidy. The game starts with each player taking a cardboard tray from
the box. Each tray contains 8 trees (two each numbered 1-4), 36 wooden
leaves, 8 leaf cards and a squirrel. The map is two-sided. One side
for 3 or 4 players and the other for two. During the spring phase
players take turns placing trees in the grid intersections. The summer
phase scores each row and column according to who has the highest and
second highest sum of numbers on their trees. Fall, of course,
consists of trees dropping leaves (or the squirrel) in the direction
of the wind that shifts each round. After dropping its leaves, each
tree is returned to the tray. And the final phase, winter, scores each
region according to who has the most and second most leaves. Clean up
the leaves after scoring and everything goes back in the box ready for
the next game.

As you can see, Bosk is lovely to look at. It's very well designed,
but I do have a number of quibbles:

* The color palette pleases the eye, but red and orange look too
  similar. Yes, the trees and leaves are different shapes, but I wish
  one of those colors were green or white or brown. It's especially
  hard when one person is marking scores while other people call out
  the colors during summer and winter. More than once I caught myself
  moving the wrong color. Also, squirrels can only be differentiated
  by color. The numbers on the orange trees are underlined, which
  shows the designer understood the problem, but it's not sufficient.
* At the start of fall, it's hard to place leaves in the center of the
  board without bumping a tree. The problem is worse with the smaller
  squares on the 3-4 player map. In addition, the glossy leaves slide
  easily when stacked. You must have sure hands when playing this game.
* On the 3-4 player board, there's a sorta pink/orange peninsula into
  the lake. (Look at the bottom right of image above.) But the two
  player map cuts that down to what looks like an island. It's a bit
  hard to tell if that island should be its own region,[^1] part of
  the pinkish region or part of the red region nearby.
* Tree numbers can be facing north-south or east-west. It wouldn't be
  sensible to put numbers on the other direction because it risks
  trees with two different numbers. So players can't easily see the
  number on every tree without moving around the board.
* The trays have flaps on the bottom that hide leaves if you dump them
  in. Better to leave the trees in their baggie or line them up on the
  table in front of you.
  
None of these harm the game in any meaningful way. I'm sure these
factors were considered and decisions made based on aesthetics and
cost. It's just I wish slightly different decisions were made.

The rulebook explains the game well and includes helpfully illustrated
examples throughout. Across the bottom of each page are facts about
various National Parks,[^2] which are entirely superfluous, but add to the
theme. Scoring is described in the text and again in chart format. One
nit I have is that notes, tips, reminders and exceptions are printed
in <font style="font-variant: small-caps">small caps</font> whether
they are critical to pay attention to or not. The also clutter up the
main flow of the rule narrative.

On the back of the rulebook is a summary of the setup, phases of play,
and a copy of the summer and winter scoring tables. There's a hiker to
mark the starting player and track the trail that's being scored. The
score track board has two sides so you can chose whether to snake
after each multiple of ten or start a new row. When fall comes, the
wind track board[^3] fits neatly on the map edge chosen by the
last-place player and a wooden arrow tracks the current wind.

As for the game itself, I find it breezy with some tricky decisions
along the way. Placing trees is critical for both the summer scoring
and ensuring you can claim territory in the fall. Summer scoring tends
to be spread more evenly than winter. Unless you are able to be the
only one to have a tree on a row or column, you aren't going to build
a significant lead.

Meanwhile, territory control in the fall is surprisingly fluid. Saving
a large numbered leaf card for the later rounds means you can cover up
opponents who seemed to have a safe lead. Alternatively, people who
use their 8 leaf card early efficiently grab a share of several
regions all at once. Squirrels, of course, are agents of chaos. 

Bosk is a [perfect information
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information). There's no
element of chance and it's theoretically possible to calculate the
best possible move. In some games that can lead to analysis paralysis
and long waits between turns. Bosk avoids that trap by giving players
narrowing choices. In chess, the best-known perfect information game,
pawns block the movement of back-row pieces for several turns until
the game opens up. A wider range of mid-game choices gives players
more to ponder. But in Bosk, each tree placed reduces the number of
open trails and scoring possibilities.

The shifting wind in the fall season also limits the possible
moves. It's usually not hard to decide which of the two trees marked
"1" to use in the first round because of the direction of the
wind. Picking how many leaves to drop (or whether to use your squirrel
card) is simplified by calculating the number of leaves needed to
reach the board edge. Each leaf dropped is constrained by where the
previous leaf fell. By the end of four rounds when the choice of trees
is opened up, there are only four trees left to pick and the situation
on the ground has become more clear.

That's not to say the choices are easy. Especially in the second-half
of the fall season it's agonizing to decide whether to solidify a
region you already are winning or spread out into an area where you
might score second place. Sometimes a tree that seemed to be minimally
valuable at the start of the fall turns out to be the game winner in
the final round.

Bosk scales well from 2-4 players. Spring usually goes quickly since
it involves nothing more than placing a tree. Fall is more involved,
but you can safely plan your turn while other people are playing
because the wind usually favors a small number of options each
round. The scoring system means it's hard to be too far behind.

Now I do find the actual scoring of the game to be a bit tedious and
underwhelming. Summer in particular is a lot of 2 and 1 point moves
with the very occasional trail scoring 3 for someone. Especially with
4 players it goes on a long time with little to show for itself in
terms of score differential. Winter is better because there are fewer
regions with higher scores.  In fact winter provides a greater share
of points in all but the 4-person game:

Players | Summer total | Summer average | Winter total | Winter average
------: | -----------: | -------------: | -----------: | -------------:
2       |           54 |           27   |           64 |             32
3       |           60 |           20   |           64 |         21 1/3
4       |           66 |           16.5 |           64 |             16

Note: this doesn't account for various tie scenarios which can reduce
the total score of a trail or region. There is also the quite rare
case of 3 or 4 players tying for first in a region that could result
in more than 8 points being awarded.

At its core, Bosk is two separate games chained together. The spring
game doesn't feel important, but it does set the stage for the
fall. Scoring in summer serves the primary purpose of spreading out
trees so they aren't clumped in the center or some other strategy
designed to capture regions in winter. Fall tests players' plans and
ability to adapt to changing situations.

Planing trees reminds me a bit of Go. Partially that's because they go
in the intersections and not the squares. But also because each placed
piece has subtle implications down the road. Placing leaves feels a
bit like [Carcassonne](/2020/03/25/carcassonne-review.html)'s farms in
that territory can be stolen by devious players. For me the problems
with the game pieces and the somewhat underwhelming summer scoring are
more than made up for by the complex puzzle of the two games.

Footnotes

[^1]: It seems like an interesting idea, but I suspect it would
    imbalance the two-player game since that one location would swing
    the game 16 points. It would almost certainly be taken by a
    squirrel immediately.
    
[^2]: Most are US National Parks, but Greenland and Canada are also
    represented.

[^3]: The other side of the wind track has "Bosk" and four leaves
    printed on it. There's no gamplay reason for that, but I imagine
    it helps sell the game at conventions.
