One of the things I've learned over the years as a moderator and
community manager is that rules lawyers can work me ragged. When I
point out a Terms of Service (ToS) violation, a rules lawyer will find
a way to avoid the letter of the law while violating the spirit. This
is especially annoying because the ToS is primarily a legal document
so it's designed to be a document for lawyers to argue over.

So when [I updated the College Confidential rules a few years
ago](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602)
I focused on:

* Simplifying the language
* Removing a bunch of sections that addressed edge cases
* Broadening the rules so that they covered a wider range of behavior
  while also
* Softening the language to give moderators discretion when it comes
  to enforcement.

Our legal team regularly updates the ToS and we do want to enforce
them. But it's best to think of ToS violations as really obvious and
severe problems. So, for instance, [the College Confidential
ToS](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/terms-of-service) bar people
from "racial" posts. While that _can_ cover a lot of things people
might write, the goal is to bar people from hosting Klan meetings on
the site. When someone violates the ToS, there should be a serious
discussion about banning their account for a very long time.

Meanwhile the rules represent broad principles that guide rather than
prescribe. "Discussion, Not Debate", for instance, gives everyone an
idea of the sort of interactions we want on the site rather than, say,
defining how many times a person can repeat their argument before it
violates the rules. If someone digs in a bit too much, it can be
corrected with a warning and an escalating series of
consequences. They have an opportunity to align their behavior to the
community norms or demonstrate they aren't interested in being good
citizens.

My thinking has been heavily influenced by [this philosophy of
moderation](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=19709)
written by the late Shamus Young. A key quote:

Another way to put it is that moderators have the site
rules/guidelines as tools designed to be a standard of behavior. But
if people are breaking the community without breaking the rules, we
don't need to just throw up our hands. I strongly suspect a few people
(maybe as few as one) cause most of the problems on most sites.  I
might have a hard time sorting things out because there are a lot of
accusations being thrown around. Just because someone breaks the rules
sometimes doesn't mean they incapable of being decent members of the
community.

So I try to identify the person who causes the most problems in a
community. I don't necessarily mean violating the rules, but rather
the person who draws the worst out of others. That might mean riling
up people they disagree with or it might mean rallying people who are
on their side. (Or both. Both happens in the same person often.)

Then I take action (usually warning or silencing them). What's
interesting in my experience is that I can usually tell from their
reply if we've found one of the true troublemakers. I really like this
image from [the article I linked to
earlier](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=19709) that
illustrates the range of people in a community:

![Fred, Han and
Jack](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/images/moderate1.jpg)

I don't usually have a problem identifying rules breakers, but most of
them are Han Solo types. They tend to adapt to the situation around
them. If there are enough Mr. Rogers types around, they generally
behave well enough.

What I want to find is the Jack; the one guy who likes nothing more
than to watch the world burn. If there isn't enough drama, he'll light
a match to the most flammable fuel he can find. If you see fires in
our community, your Jack is sure to be right there looking as innocent
as possible.
