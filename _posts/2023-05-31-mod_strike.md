Yesterday, Stack Exchange Inc released a ["network policy
regarding AI Generated
content"](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content). I
encourage you to read it in full. A quick summary:

* According to internal analysis, moderators have misdiagnosed cased
  of users contributing AI-generated content.
* Internal evidence also leads the company to believe "there have been
  biases for or against residents of specific countries".
* Moderators have been given a strict standard (not spelled out
  publicly) for determining when a post has been "AI-authored".
* Most of the suspensions handed out by moderators would not have
  happened if these standards were already in place.
* GPT detectors (algorithms designed to detect these posts) are not
  considered reliable because of their high false positive rate.
* Moderators may continue to act on users with a pattern of
  low-quality posts.
* This policy did not follow the new moderator agreement policy change
  policy.
  
It's looking like at least some of the moderators on the Stack
Exchange network are [discussing a possible
strike](https://discord.gg/FCWJXZM). It's been relatively quite since
[a number of moderators
resigned](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342039/firing-community-managers-stack-exchange-is-not-interested-in-cooperating-with)
three years ago. Once again, the company has shown it does not trust
it's volunteer moderators. This time it appears moderators don't
intend to resign, but rather stop engaging with the network.

AOL (of disc-in-the-mail fame) had a Community Leader program that was
[investigated by the Department of
Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Community_Leader_Program#Department_of_Labor_investigation). The
company eventually settled a class-action lawsuit. The question was
not settled, but there is a chance companies who treat volunteer
moderators as employees could be required to pay them. It's a concern
I have with [College Confidential moderators
too](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/moderator-election-next-steps/3618521). I've
had moderators resign because they disagree with top-down policies,
but that's never my preference.

There are legitimate concerns about moderation surrounding ChatGPT and
similar technologies. This particular policy seems heavy-handed and
ill-conceived. It's always better to talk with moderators directly
about these problems rather than impose a policy on short
notice. There's perhaps time for the company to correct this, but not
much time. Things are moving quickly and I somehow suspect the company
won't be ready for what comes next.
