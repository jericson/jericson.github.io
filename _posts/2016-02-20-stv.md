As I write this, Donald Trump is about to win the South Carolina
Republican primary even though most people predict he'd
[lose a two candidate race](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-donald-trump-have-a-ceiling/). The
problem can be summed up with this (hypothetical) chart:

Percentage | First choice | Second choice | Third choice
---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------
33%        | Trump        | N/A           | N/A
22%        | Rubio        | Cruz          | N/A
22%        | Cruz         | Rubio         | N/A
8%         | Bush         | Rubio         | Cruz
8%         | Kasich       | Rubio         | Cruz
7%         | Carson       | Cruz          | Rubio

Trump supporters tend to be pretty adamant about their candidate, so
let's suppose they wouldn't bother to vote if he weren't running. And
let's suppose that Cruz and Rubio supporters would rather have the
other candidate rather than Trump. And let's suppose Bush, Kasich and
Carson are stealing votes that would go to one of the leading
"not-Trump" candidates. In this scenario, it's clear that Trump is
only in play because the rest of the field is divided. He'd lose to
Rubio in a two-candidate race.

This is precisely the sort of paradox that
[single transferable vote (STV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)
systems are designed to resolve. While the math can be daunting, the
idea is rather simple. Instead of waiting for candidates to drop out,
an STV system allows voters to rank their preferences and resolve the
voting accordingly. So in the example above, Carson, as the
least-supported candidate, would be dropped and his votes would be
transferred to Cruz.[^1] The new tally would be:

Percentage | First choice | Second choice | Third choice
---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------
33%        | Trump        | N/A           | N/A
29%        | Cruz         | Rubio         | N/A
22%        | Rubio        | Cruz          | N/A
8%         | Bush         | Rubio         | Cruz
8%         | Kasich       | Rubio         | Cruz

Then the process of dropping the candidate with the least votes would
continue until some candidate gets a majority:

Percentage | First choice 
---------- | ------------ 
67%        | Rubio
33%        | Trump

It's as simple as that.[^2]

Moderators on Stack Exchange are elected using single transferable
vote because we believe it provides the best method for representing
the interests of broad and diverse communities.[^3] Instead of forcing
voters to judge whether a candidate might be popular among other
voters, the system allows people to vote their preferences without
throwing away their vote on losing candidates.

My cousin, Mark Ericson, asked:

> Except in proportional states STV wouldn't be dropping candidates
until someone has a majority.  It probably would be dropping
candidates who don't achieve sufficient votes to get at least one
delegate.  What would the results look like then?

I think the answer depends on how the parties want to divide up their
delegates. Republicans award some South Carolina delegates to the
winner of the entire state and other delegates to the winners of the
congressional districts. The Democrats have something called
[superdelegates](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/superdelegates-might-not-save-hillary-clinton/)
who aren't committed to anyone until the convention. So the
presidential primaries are the ultimate in political theater and the
parties haven't really put much time into making it fair.

It turns out the Super Tuesday states require a candidate to earn
[15-20% of the vote](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/upshot/mainstream-gop-field-of-three-faces-brutal-delegate-math.html)
in order to get a share of the delegates. STV systems can handle this
quirk by setting a
[quota variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota). In a two
person race, the quota is a simple majority. But it can be set to
anything at all if the election rules require it. If it were set to
20%, the results might look something like:

Percentage | Candidate
---------- | ---------
38%        | Rubio
33%        | Trump
29%        | Cruz

Again, this is hypothetical. This method would be more fair to people
who vote for a candidate who just falls short because their votes
transfer up. The existing system doesn't have any way to account for
their preferences, so the smart thing to do is vote only for people
who are reasonably likely to get 20% of the vote.

[^1]: To simplify the explanation, I'm assuming _all_ of the
    supporters of Carson would have identical preferences. In reality,
    other candidates, including Trump, would pick up some of those
    votes.

[^2]: Again, the real world is a bit more complicated because some
    people would have Trump as their second or third choice over
    Rubio. There would also be people who leave both Rubio and Trump
    off their ballots resulting in "wasted" votes. Finally, the party
    might decide it worthwhile to award delegates proportionally to,
    say, the top three candidates. On Stack Exchange, we use the more
    sophisticated
    [Meek algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes#Meek)
    that solves all of these problems.

[^3]: Even the fact that we allow our users to select moderators at
    all is
    [a bit unusual](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/31376/3252).
