This morning, I've been ignoring my children fighting[^1] and the
sound of a dripping faucet[^2] by reading old
[Fire Joe Morgan](https://www.firejoemorgan.com/) posts. Man, I need
vacation. Kinda like the vacation I just got back from a couple of
weeks ago. Which, as I write this, might not have actually been as
effective as I hoped.

Even so, let's press on with the top, um, `X` tips for how to vacation
when your job is conducted entirely online:

1. _Try to finish everything other people need from you before you leave._

   So, this is where you might as well give up before you even
   start. What I should have actually said: "_Pretend_ you've
   finished everything you needed to do before you leave". This year I
   left tons of people waiting, but I did pretend that I'd finished
   the
   [functional specification](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html)
   for a new feature.[^3] As a result, I spent only an inordinate amount
   of time thinking about work after I left. The more time
   you think about your work, the less likely you are to benefit from
   not thinking about your work. You see, **vacations are to work as
   sleep is to,** uh, **work**. Brains need retooling too. 

   Community managers (and moderators for that matter) probably should
   tell their colleagues about an absence. We should _not_ worry about
   resolving outstanding community problems, however. For one thing,
   most every issue will be resolved whether you are actively working
   on it or not. For another, you are more likely to block community
   action as enable it in the final days of preparation. Finally, it's
   better to let people notice you are gone than express apathy (or
   worse, joy) that you are leaving. While we are on the topic...
   
2. _Leave your house._

   I can't stress enough that if you don't walk away from the desk,
   you aren't really on vacation. Ideally, you'll travel far enough
   away from your cocoon that you are a bit uncomfortable. To give you
   an idea of how much I believe in this principle, I actually left
   the Burbank bubble. You see, if you don't separate yourself
   physically, you won't actually be able to mentally separate
   yourself from work. You could probably flip a coin at every
   intersection and travel randomly (my father actually used to do
   this after church to find new lunch places) and be better off than
   sitting at home. "Staycation" is a synonym for "working". Which
   reminds me...

3. _Don't open your laptop._

   Just about every manager does a little routine whenever they take
   more than a few hours away from the office. "Hey guys," they'll
   say, "I'm going to be out for a while, but if you need me for
   anything, I'll be reading my email. Actually, here's my phone
   number, the address of where I'll be, and I've rented a sat
   phone. Use any of them if you want my input or even if you just
   feel like chatting." If it weren't a sign of weakness, some
   managers would confess that they get all meaning out of life from
   working. If you log into the community you are managing while
   away, it's exactly the same effect.

   I'd be hypocritical to tell you to not _bring_ your laptop, because
   I brought mine with me. What I _didn't do_, however, was use
   it. Well, I did use it to charge my phone. Speaking of which...

4. _Don't abuse your phone privilege._

   Let's get real: I'm going to tell you to leave your phone in
   airplane mode and you are going to pretend that you need it to get
   directions to the cheese factory tour when really you are sneaking
   peaks at your email notifications. Just like the dance between a
   preteen and their parents, we both know that such rules will be
   bent like so many pretzels. So let's just be clear, if your
   coworkers (or spouse) figure out that you were working instead of
   vacationing, they have my permission to mock you for failing at not
   working. Alternatively, imagine what how
   [Iron Eyes Cody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Eyes_Cody)
   would feel if he found out you were corrupting the American
   institution of a family road trip:

   [![Keep America Vacationing](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/People_Start_Pollution_-_1971_Ad.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_America_Beautiful)

   You will be this sad too, unless you...

5. _Lower your expectations._

    Shortly after we returned from our vacation with my family, Joy
    passed around this article on Facebook:
    [Vacation or Trip? A Helpful Guide for Parents](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/m-blazoned/vacation-or-trip-a-helpful-guide-for-parents_b_7789310.html). It
    was painfully funny to her, but I kinda thought the guidance was
    obvious. Vacations are about escape, so if your goal is to escape
    the life of a mother for a few weeks, you shouldn't bother taking
    your children. Vacations (sorry, "trips") are best when they fail
    in ways that will be hilarious to future you. Driving though
    rush-hour traffic in a car that's engulfed in white smoke like
    some sort of cartoon cloud isn't a laughing matter until you've
    finished suffering the consequences and started telling the story
    as if it happened to someone else. Very few events are as life
    changing as they seem in the moment, so it's best to treat
    vacations like those chapters in Moby Dick that describe the
    whaling industry: diversions from the main plot.

    Vacations have greatest impact when they break up the flow of
    life, even if they aren't pleasant. To be clear, I had a great
    trip since I spent a good deal of it fishing at places like:

    ![Upper Hazard](/images/upper_hazard.jpg)

    There was no cellphone coverage, so I missed a lot of events
    online. That can be discouraging if you don't...

6. _Pretend that everything that happened while you were gone was unimportant._

   Sure there are going to be things that you are idly curious about
   and it's ok to ask around. But don't feel the slightest
   _obligation_ to "catch up" or you risk losing all the benefit you
   might have gained from going in the first place. Seriously, it
   might feel like the world falls apart when you aren't looking, but
   it's just not true. Give yourself a break.

So, in summary, I can't wait for my anniversary trip next month. Or
rather: vacation.

Footnotes:

[^1]: Mostly sleep, but also each other.

[^2]: The shower fixtures are one of the few things we did not tear
      out during our remodel this spring because I'd replaced them
      seven years ago when we moved in. But it turns out that a
      critical peice is made of
      [pot metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_metal) for some
      reason which has meant I've had to replace it with aluminum
      foil. Oddly, that's not what caused the leak. In the meantime, I
      turned off the water to the house after we all had showered so
      that we don't feel guilty about our role in California's
      drought. This evening's entertainment will either be teaching
      our potty-training toddlers how to bucket flush or locking
      myself into the bathroom until I fix the leak or break down in
      tears trying.

      If this footnote confuses you, read the rest of the first
      sentence. If that still doesn't help, take a moment to watch
      [David Eckstein, Attorney at Law](https://www.si.com/mlb/strike-zone/2013/10/25/david-eckstein-parks-and-recreation),
      which won't make anything more clear as it turns out.

[^3]: As an added bonus,
     [the feature](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260849/proposed-micro-privilege-site-analytics)
     was ready for my review when I got back.
