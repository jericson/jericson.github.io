I'm currently running the game and attempting to host a public
game. Unfortunately, nobody else is playing the game and it appears
there's no way to play the game without other players. There's also no
way to back out of the wait screen without ending the game via the
OS. So I haven't been able to play the game and I've gotten to know
the options menu pretty well.

The volume slider is kinda funky. When starting the game, the music
(royalty free <a
href="https://www.incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1500054">Funky
Chunk</a> by Kevin MacLeod) plays at full volume. But when you go to
the options menu, the slider is all the way to the left. Grabbing the
slider and moving it to the right a bit turns down the volume. Putting
the slider back to full left stops the music. This option is not
saved, so if you don't want the music too loud, you need to do this
process each time you start the game. And don't forget to do it before
hitting the "Play" button as it's impossible to open the options menu
after that point.

You also start off the game in fullscreen at maximum quality and
resolution. If I were going to be able to play the game, that would be
fine. But all I can do is wait in the game lobby forever, so I want it
to be windowed.

I get that this is a game designed to be streamed for laughs. It would
be a wasted <strike>pizza</strike> development effort to implement
bots. But surely the developers could have allowed players to enter
the gamespace without an opponent at all. Since they didn't bother to
make that available, this game is not playable at this time.
