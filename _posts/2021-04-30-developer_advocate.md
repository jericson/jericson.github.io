My [job hunt](/2021/04/23/job_hunting.html) is over and, as promised,
I'm writing about my latest job ever. I'm going to be a [Developer
Advocate at
EDB](https://www.builtinboston.com/job/engineer/developer-advocate/47595). Not
coincidentally at all, my friend [Shog9 is _also_ Developer Advocate at
EDB](https://twitter.com/shog9/status/1233591329491283968). Guess I've
been starving for stories about apple farming. Or maybe I don't want
to break [my streak of getting jobs because people already know
me](/2020/07/08/reader_mail.html).

I... can't really believe this is happening. It's pretty normal for me
to assume there will be some mistake and actually I don't have a
job. Not sure why because I'm normally optimistic. But I have a UPS
tracking number that suggests my laptop is on it's way and I signed a
bunch of documents before my (presumed) start date on Monday. I
finally feel comfortable writing about what I'm going to be
doing. (And in six months I'll read this and _laugh and laugh_ at how
naive I once was.)

## My neighbor's tankless heater.

The guy next door has been building a house for well over a year and a
half. I used to see him come over to inspect the progress. A month or
two ago he finally moved in. I was so glad not to hear construction
sounds during the day. But he also installed two external tankless
water heaters and every morning at 8:30 I hear this horrific
whine. I'm familiar with the sound since I also have an external
tankless heater and it used to make the same noise.

![My tankless water heater.](/images/tankless.jpg)

For clarity, this is _my_ tankless unit that I installed with the help
of my father-in-law. We have plans to fix the jank.

Anyway, the problem is likely the result of harmonic resonance in the
flexible gas line. It's a common problem for natural game appliances
such as fireplaces, fire pits and tankless heaters. One solution is to
use a flex line that has alternating ridge patterns which break up the
flow enough to avoid an annoying whistle.

I bring it up because consumers who replace their water heater tanks
with tankless are likely to just reuse the gas line that was already
in place. Since tankless heaters need much higher gas volume while hot
water is running, they are far more susceptible to whistling flex
lines. So the average person installing these systems is liable to
blame the heater (which is new) and not the line (which worked just
fine before).

I'd suggest manufacturers of tankless heaters need "installer
advocates" to surface this sort of problem to the rest of the
company. First, someone has to know the problem exists even though
it's not directly related to the product they sell. Second, someone
needs to make sure installers are aware of the solution. Maybe the
installation manual could call the problem out clearly. The model I
have warned that "gas flex lines are not recommended", but doesn't say
why. Clearer warnings about the whistle problem might have helped.

Other solutions might be:

* Include the right sort of flex line with the unit. (But that adds to
  the expense and many customers won't need it.)
* Promote a line of instructional videos in which experts explain the problem.
* Design the heater with a microphone that detects a whistle and
  adjusts the flow rate to eliminate it. (Again adding to the expense
  and maybe not practical.)

## The job listing

Normally job listings run together for me, but [the one for my new
job](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424161641/https://www.builtinboston.com/job/engineer/developer-advocate/47595)
is different. <!--(I've pasted a copy of the whole thing at the bottom of
this post in case the link stops working in the future.)--> Some parts of
the description spoke to me in particular.

> As a Developer Advocate, you will join a team of user experience and
> software development professionals on a mission to make working with
> Postgres easier for developers, data scientists, data wranglers,
> operators, and the ever-expanding ecosystem of technologists who rely

> Experience Officer.

Two things:

1. The job is making Postgres easier to use.
2. I report directly to the [Chief Experience
   Officer](https://www.enterprisedb.com/brad-noble).
   
So this isn't a marketing job (directly) and there's not a lot of
management layers. That's good news because it means we can tackle
whatever might be the Postgres equivalents of whistling flex
lines. One of the painful points of being a community manager around
the time I left Stack Overflow was there were so many people in the
hierarchy we regularly got mixed messages about what we were
responsible for.

> * Make Postgres easier: identify points of friction in Postgres and
>   EDB products, develop approaches to address them

I've used Oracle, MS SQL Server, mySQL and SQLite. Each of these has
strengths and weaknesses. I've only recently gotten into Postgres and
I like what I see:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dipping my

> * Identify and engage with new communities which stand to benefit from Postgres

A paradox of community management is you don't need to be an extrovert
to do the work. I'm the sort of introvert who is happy to chat about
some topic of interest, but once the conversation moves to mundane
territory, I struggle to maintain interest. It is an act of love
(rarely recognized) when I studiously listen to someone else's
concerns. More to the point, it takes energy for me to stay engaged.

But this sort of work, telling people about a technology that excites
me, also energized me. Speaking of which:

> * Collaborate with product, engineering, and marketing teams 

Y'all won't believe I'm an introvert when I tell you I loved this part
of the job at Stack Overflow and College Confidential. And yes, I even
enjoyed meeting with marketing. Again, being able to talk about
interesting topics made all the difference. 

> * Talk to Postgres users and EDB customers and listen for not only
>   their needs but also their ideas for the future of Postgres

Ultimately the secret to community management is leaning on incredible
people who know (and care) more than you do about the product. 

> * Willingness to analyze, understand, and extend existing cultural and
>   technical systems

When I read this requirement, I knew this was the job for me. It
really is my happy place.

More job listings should include something like this. I'm confident I
do check most of the boxes, but some of the best candidates for this
sort of work [know how hard it can
be](/2021/03/23/2021_CMX_report.html). They need a bit of
encouragement to stretch their skills a bit.

And that's what I hope I'll be able to do starting next week.
