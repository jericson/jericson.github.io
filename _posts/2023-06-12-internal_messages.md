title: What Stack Overflow is telling employees about the strike
tags: community strike
comments: true
---

I recently received two pieces of internal Stack Overflow
communication about the "moderator action" that started on
June 5. Obviously I'm [no longer an employee by Stack
Overflow](/2020/01/17/leaving_stack.html), so these documents have
been leaked to me. It's natural to wonder who leaked them and
why. Some might guess it's someone I know from my time there who is
sympathetic to the moderators' cause. That guess is wrong. It wasn't
anyone on the community team or a developer. I don't know why this
person contacted me other than they had read my recent blog posts. 

Deciding to publish these documents wasn't easy. I worry about the
negative side-effects of releasing this material, which was never
intended for public consumption. In particular, I worry about my
friends at the company being wrongly accused, about driving the wedge
between community and company deeper, and harming Stack Exchange.[^1] 

On the other hand, the strike has been organized on a Discord channel
that employees have access to. Non-employees don't have access to the
company's side of the discussion, so there is an information
imbalance. Unfortunately, it's aligned with the substantial power
differential. Moderators have quite a bit of influence over the
community, but their administrative power is given and taken away by
the company.

The documents below combined with recent company actions lead me to
believe the company will not be negotiating in good faith. The crux of
the [prisoner's
dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is that
the parties can't (or simply don't) communicate. If they could
coordinate, each would get a better deal. But even when the parties
are able to communicate and do come to an agreement, there's still a
risk one party will defect anyway in order to get the better deal and
stick the other party with a booby prize. Reading the documents below
changed my estimate of the odds that Stack Exchange Inc will ignore
the results of negotiation when it is convenient for them.

## Email to managers

I'm going to post both documents in full first so that you can
evaluate them yourself. Later in this post, I'll share my
thoughts. First up, we have an email sent to Stack Overflow
managers. I believe it was sent on June 5 because that's the date on
the FAQ and also when approximately 11% of moderators had signed the
strike letter.[^2]

## FAQ attachment

The email mentioned an attached FAQ. It had a June 5 date on it. I've
redacted the names of people who have not made public statements about
the strike. I've also reformatted the document, but not in a way that
changes the meaning.

## My interpretation

SLT stands for Senior Leadership Team, which probably includes [these
people](https://stackoverflow.co/company/leadership). I don't know who
else, if anyone, is on that team. It appears
[Philippe](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/936316/philippe), VP
of Community, is taking on internal communication and probably is the
primary author of these documents. It's hard to know how much
influence he has over the policy at the center of the strike.


Nothing in the email itself is surprising. It's a watered down view of
the situation that seems designed to reassure employees that the
matter is in hand. There's no point in alarming the majority of the
company who doesn't interact with the community each day. But this
sentence stands out:

> We do not know what it will take to end this action, nor do we know
> how long they are prepared to engage in this, but we will do our
> part to bring things to a speedy resolution; one that's best for our
> company, our community, and our customers.

By June 5, the strike demands were made clear in [the strike
letter](https://openletter.mousetail.nl/) (emphasis mine):[^3]

> Until Stack Overflow, Inc. **retracts this policy change** to a degree
> that addresses the concerns of the moderators, **and allows moderators
> to effectively enforce established policies against AI-generated
> answers**, we are calling for a general moderation strike, as a
> last-resort effort to protect the Stack Exchange platform and users
> from a total loss in value.

It's possible this line in the email was meant to signify that company
leadership isn't sure what it would take to address moderators
concerns. Or maybe it was allowing for the possibility that moderators
could add more demands during negotiation. But when you add in the
FAQ, I think it's more likely the company doesn't want to give
employees a complete picture of what the strike is about:

> We have not been presented with any demands, and don't anticipate
> that we will until the action begins.

Since the FAQ directly quotes from the strike letter (to answer "What
does this mean?"), there is no possibility that the document had been
written before the strike letter was made public. And since at least
one demand (to retract the policy change that is the subject of the
letter) was made, this answer is incorrect. Or, to be crass, the FAQ
is lying to employees.

Strangely, the section about "firing" moderators obliquely refers to
the key demand:

> Nonetheless, we are certain our course of action (i.e. pausing the
> usage of highly flawed ChatGPT detectors) best serves the company,
> the community, and our customers.

Of course the moderators _aren't demanding ChatGPT detectors_, but
being able to take any action against ChatGPT content at all.[^4] The
[public
policy](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content)
implies moderators can use the "low-quality post" standard. In
practice, that's no help because GPT-generated answers _look
reasonable_ and only reveal themselves to be low quality when the
content fails to answer the question. As [Donald Knuth
notes](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/chatGPT20.txt):

> The most immediate impression is the quality of the wordsmithing.
It's way better than 99% of copy that people actually write. It's
definitely not like a Markov model that uses the most predictable way
to continue what's already been said.

If moderators are unable to remove machine-generated content that
happens to be correct, they must either leave it for unsuspecting
visitors to get tripped up on or test each and every answer on the
site for correctness. Non-programmers rarely appreciate the degree to
which questions turn on details such as the _exact version_ of
languages and libraries. Moderating is time consuming enough without a
requirement to create unit tests for every answer.

I mentioned the quality standards in point six of [my steel man
argument](/2023/06/07/strike_progress.html). People new to the network
naïvely assume moderators are subject matter experts. It's easy to see
why since they are invariably experts on some site subjects. Nobody
can be an expert on _every_ subject asked about on Stack
Overflow. [Highly upvoted and unanswered
questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51792750/how-might-i-get-detailed-database-error-messages-from-dplyrtbl)[^5]
suggest _nobody_ is an expert on some questions. Unfortunately, LLMs
happily pretend they know the unknowable.

It's not surprising the company is avoiding the word "strike". As I
[noted previously](/2023/05/31/mod_strike.html), volunteer moderators
are not currently classified as employees by the Department of
Labor. If the company used "strike" language, that would indicate it
considers them employees rather than volunteers. This is also why
"firing" moderators is put in quotes. 

The FAQ references [the pronoun
affair](/2020/04/03/pronoun_retro.html) in order to dismiss it. This
suggests the company failed to learn the lesson it should have three
years ago. Despite being a company closely associated with a
community, leadership was focused on other things (particularly an
exit strategy for investors). When <strike>the Eye of Sauron</strike>
leadership focus returned temporarily to the community, it assumed
volunteer moderators can be directed as if they were employees.

It's hard to sympathize with the company needing to replace
community-operated systems. For years leadership studiously ignored
community concerns so that they were only addressed by individual
developers (which buys a lot of community trust) or members of the
community. Now that the community is on strike and their tools aren't
working for the company, it'd be pretty handy to have [the staff it
recently laid off](2023/05/17/so_business.html).

> This is also an opportunity for us to work with the mods to advance
> some of our own ideas about creating a friendlier and more welcoming
> site.

The company has been working on this problem for [almost 11
years](https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/07/20/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/). I'm
not saying to give up on the idea, but maybe spend some time trying to
understand why the problem persists. [Conflict is inevitable in mature
communities](/2023/05/26/community_conflict.html), so the important
thing is giving communities tools to manage it. Stack Overflow has
always had options besides blaming moderators, but that's the path of
least resistance.

Over and over, these documents use the formula:

> best for our company, our community, and our customers

There are small variations, but "best" invariably applies to those
three parties. It sounds good since those three parties are pretty
important in this ecosystem. The trick is that "company" and
"customer" are fairly well-defined, but ["community"
isn't](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/393552/an-account-of-my-meeting-with-the-stack-overflow-management-team/393553#393553). The
email and FAQ focus on moderators without mentioning the majority of
the signatories who the letter categorizes as "contributors and
users". That, combined with the mention of becoming more "welcoming",
suggests leadership considers itself to be a
[rescuer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311874/why-is-se-giving-so-much-attention-to-the-be-nice-policy/311933#311933)
in the drama triangle and the moderators as persecutors. But the
company can't solve all (or perhaps any) of the community's problems
on its own. Unfortunately, leadership lacks flexibility when it comes
to outcomes.

To make matters worse, these internal documents promise "quick" and
"speedy" resolutions. That's setting up employees to blame the
moderators for an extended strike. I joked that ["extrapolating the
trend, Stack Overflow will have negative questions in 16 months or
so"](/2023/06/02/strike_comentary.html). It's probably less funny[^6]
for the company since it hits the bottom line. In public Philippe
takes [a more dire
tone](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389928/gpt-on-the-platform-data-actions-and-outcomes):

> If there is no future for a network where mods _can’t_ assess posts
> on the basis of GPT authorship (where we would be after this
> policy), and if there is no future for a network where mods _can_
> assess posts on the basis of GPT authorship (where we are today),
> then there is no future for the network at all.

This is a classic [false
dichotomy](https://www.fallacyfiles.org/eitheror.html). One possible
future (as of a couple of weeks ago) was for the company to discuss
their data with moderators and collaborate on a solution that didn't
involve sparking a "moderator action". It's clear time is not on the
company's side, but it's not clear that the community is under any
time pressure at all.

[^1]: Both the communities and their host.

[^2]: I went into detail about why that 11% number is misleading in [a
    previous post](/2023/06/07/strike_progress.html).  If we take the
    email's estimate of 600 total moderators (only off by 62), 11% of
    moderators is ~66 total. On [June 5 at 08:16:18
    GMT](https://web.archive.org/web/20230605081618/https://openletter.mousetail.nl/),
    67 moderators had signed the strike letter. By [14:29:37, 78 had
    signed](https://web.archive.org/web/20230605142937/https://openletter.mousetail.nl/)
    so we can narrow down the time to shortly after 0800 GMT when the
    email got its final draft.

[^3]: Indeed [the first draft of the
    letter](https://gist.github.com/superplane39/12e8e7692c54f3e647364e0b066b06c2/revisions#diff-6599f0b6665dc4e859f0d1d6456ace7af5bc596a8bbaef2a8ebd9dac39f3351b)
    makes clear retracting the [network
    policy](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content)
    was the core of the strike's demands.
   
[^4]: The most prolific moderator in terms of handling ChatGPT flags
    [doesn't use detection
    tools](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389811/moderation-strike-stack-overflow-inc-cannot-consistently-ignore-mistreat-an/389844#389844).
   
[^5]: There was an answer to [my
    question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51792750/how-might-i-get-detailed-database-error-messages-from-dplyrtbl)
    which was deleted by a moderator as a ChatGPT answer. It seemed
    reasonable enough, but I couldn't understand it. I also couldn't
    test the answer myself since it'd been over 4 years and I no
    longer had access the machine where my code was running. The core
    suggestion was use another library, which might work, but doesn't
    answer my question. And yes, it was a ChatGPT answer since the
    user credited https://chat.openai.com/chat in the answer.

[^6]: Assuming it's funny at all to anyone.
