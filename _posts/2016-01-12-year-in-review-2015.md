> I think we have to enjoy what we do if we are to succeed.—[John
> Wooden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden)

Looking back on the past year across the network, it strikes me that
we are very fortunate that so many people take pleasure in sharing
their knowledge with others. Everything we (as a company and as a
community) accomplished was made possible by that singular reality.

![Stack
Overfl0,000,000!](/images/3dd7ec6cf6427c4992762a0be2919fa5843a7b73-302x85.png)

Since [last year’s
report](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/year-in-review-2014/),
we [changed our company
name](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/09/were-changing-our-name-back-to-stack-overflow/)
(back) to Stack Overflow and got an
[epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uipTZ2re4Uk) new logo. Partly
it’s simple branding; causal visitors recognize Stack Overflow and
other individual sites rather than the network as a whole. Another
reason reflects the reality of our (current) goal: [building
programmer
Jerusalem](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-stack-exchange/).

This year alone users asked 2.5 million questions and contributed 3.2
million answers on our flagship site. People gave out 16 million
upvotes last year and for the fourth straight year more than a million
questions were answered to the askers’ satisfaction. That's a lot of
programming puzzles solved. Not every post started as a gem of
perfection (there were 2.3 million downvotes), but nearly 10 million
comments and 3.4 million edits sorted many of them out. (These
statistics come from [public
data](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/419383/yearly-stats?year=2015&opt.textResults=true). Feel
free to look up the results for *your* favorite site.)

Nearly two years ago we
[expanded](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/)
the Stack Overflow community beyond English. This year the experiment
paid off: Stack Overflow em Português [graduated from beta
status](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/06/stack-overflow-in-portuguese-now-with-less-beta/). Building
on that success, we started a [Japanese-language Stack
Overflow](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/stack-overflow-in-japanese/),
[absorbed](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/06/welcome-nicolas-chabanovsky-and-stack-overflow-in-russian/)
a Stack Overflow in Russian, and [Stack Overflow en
Español](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/08/welcome-juan-garza-and-stack-overflow-en-espa%C3%B1ol/)
began its beta. Non-English Stack Overflow sites collectively field
[159 questions per
day](http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday). None of this
activity seems to have come at the expense of the English site—people
just enjoy sharing knowledge using the language in which they are most
comfortable.

Have you ever looked at your digital collection (books, movies, music,
games and so on) and realized you have titles you’ve never consumed
and don’t even remember obtaining? Stack Exchange is like that
**except all 150 communities prove to be amazing**. As a Community
Manager, I’m obviously biased in my evaluation—except the quality of
these sites has almost nothing to do with us. Instead credit goes to
the thousands of core users who write posts, improve them and vote up
the best content. Excluding Stack Overflow, users asked 967,039
questions and provided 1.3 million answers. Over 4 million comments
helped clarify those posts and people submitted 1.6 million
edits. There were 7.1 million upvotes and 1 million downvotes to rank
posts and reward authors with reputation. In addition to the 3 million
reviews completed on Stack Overflow, 1.5 million posts were reviewed
on other sites. Askers "accepted" 402,647 answers as particularly
helpful in 2015.

Answers don’t just benefit the people who ask the questions
either. Last year the Stack Exchange network (including Stack
Overflow) racked up [8 billion page
views](https://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc#/trafficCard). Nearly
all of that traffic came from people searching the internet at large
and discovering an answer on the network. Quantcast ranks the
stackexchange.com domain (excluding the
[trilogy](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/)
and sites with custom URLs) in the [top 50 US
sites](https://www.quantcast.com/top-sites/US/1). 

In order to handle that much activity we need a massive data
center, right? Well, not really. After serving faithfully for four
years, [we
upgraded](http://blog.serverfault.com/2015/03/05/how-we-upgrade-a-live-data-center/)
the hardware in our "New York" data center. Instead of failing over to
our backup data center in Oregon (which was moved to Denver in June),
the Site Reliability Engineering team updated hardware live. This
requires careful planning and plenty of redundancy: 11 web servers,
two SQL clusters, two Redis servers, etc. Most of the time those
machines run at single-digit CPU load. We expect the new hardware to
keep up with the load for the next four years.

We used to joke that all of our sites should be named "$topic *for
programmers*". But as sites and the network mature, that’s getting
less true. Last year the network expanded to 17 new topics, including
[Woodworking](http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/), [Music
Fans](http://musicfans.stackexchange.com/),
[Health](http://health.stackexchange.com/), and
[Law](http://law.stackexchange.com/). Instead of renaming to Stack
Overflow, we could have gone with Socratic University: there just
aren’t many topics you *can’t* ask about. Several of our sites,
especially the mathematically oriented ones, boast serious academic
chops. Papers regularly [cite
posts](http://meta.mathoverflow.net/a/2436/36770) from [Theoretical
Computer Science](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/),
[Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/),
[MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/) and
[Physics](http://physics.stackexchange.com/). A tiny sample of the
smörgåsbord of tasty content posted last year: Gaming wins the title
of most viewed question with:

1. [How do I deliver a
   baby?](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/223800) Presumably
   a fair number of the 867,960 views were to figure out what game the
   question is about.
2. [Why does "effective. Power" text crash the iPhone
   OS?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189045) (Apple,
   448,473 views)
3. [How to disable the "Get Windows 10" icon shown in the notification
   area (tray)?](http://superuser.com/questions/922068) (SuperUser,
   416,421 views)

The top voted answers?

The community team used to imagine that we could individually evaluate
every site in detail. But even after
[hiring](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/04/jnat-and-animuson-workin-on-ur-problemz/)[four](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/06/pivoting-into-a-new-career-please-welcome-taryn-pratt-bluefooted-community-manager/)[more](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/08/welcome-juan-garza-and-stack-overflow-en-espa%C3%B1ol/)
people we just can't scale as quickly as the network has. Fortunately,
our subjective evaluations of Stack Exchange sites, small and large,
show they're exceptionally committed to quality. As a result we’ve
switched to [objective site
evaluations](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/1438) (Daniel
Kahneman would be proud) and graduated a record number of beta sites:

1. [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/)
2. [Movies](http://movies.stackexchange.com/)
3. [Chemistry](http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/)
4. [Stack Overflow em Português](http://pt.stackoverflow.com/)
5. [Biology](http://biology.stackexchange.com/)
6. [Network Engineering](http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/)
7. [Cryptography](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/)
8. [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/)
9. [Stack Overflow на русском](http://ru.stackoverflow.com/)
10. [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/)

Our designers worked with each of these communities to come up with
pleasing designs that fit the aesthetic of each topic. In addition,
[WordPress Development](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/) and
[Skeptics](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/) got beautiful
redesigns. Additionally, most sites were updated to use the Less
preprocessor, polished for higher-resolution monitors and have [new
profile
pages](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/04/two-new-user-pages-one-new-stat-this-on/). This
very blog got an
[overhaul](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/07/the-new-stack-exchange-blog/)
too. We've been [hiring
designers](http://stackexchange.com/work-here/87771/senior-product-designer),
but not as fast as our sites are growing. So the following sites
elected moderators while awaiting their designs:

1. [Blender](http://blender.stackexchange.com/)
2. [Computer Science](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)
3. [Anime and Manga](http://anime.stackexchange.com/)
4. [Magento](http://magento.stackexchange.com/)
5. [English Language Learners](http://ell.stackexchange.com/)
6. [Japanese Language and Usage](http://japanese.stackexchange.com/)
7. [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/)
8. [Musical Practice and Performance](http://music.stackexchange.com/)

After five years of [democratically electing
moderators](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/),
it’s mind blowing that Stack Exchange is *still* the only major
network (with the [notable exception of
Wikipedia](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/31377/3252)) that
embraces this form of self-governance. It’s a strategic advantage we
wish more internet communities would adopt. We simply cannot thank our
476 [volunteer
moderators](http://stackexchange.com/about/moderators?by=users) enough
for their patience and dedication.

At "Stack Exchange, Inc doing business as Stack Overflow", we think of
our communities as our partners. The company’s responsibility is to
provide our users with the very best platform for helping each other
and creating lasting artifacts. This year, we plan to roll out some
[mighty big
changes](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/310066/stack-overflow-serving-programmers-even-better)
that we expect will improve the lives the world’s software
developers. (If you are a programmer, please take [our
survey](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/314186/stack-overflow-annual-survey-2016)
to help us know how to serve you better.) As with Q&A, we intend to
open these features up to other domains as makes sense.

We aren’t finished with our existing products either. Each week, the
community team asks our developers for three or so improvements often
selected from the various Meta sites in the network. Some of them are
small, such as [allowing privileges links to be clicked without
JavaScript](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/208667/allow-privileges-links-to-be-clicked-without-javascript). But
we’ve also fixed highly upvoted requests such as [preventing canonical
questions from being
deleted](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221619/auto-flag-duplicates-of-deleted-questions-for-reopening-deletion). JNat
put together [a
report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b7191M2e2NnDJu11qKsV1ld8GiMjuv73UHT9gVX-H9k/edit?usp=sharing)
describing the 75 requests directly benefiting either the community or
moderators. He also
[reports](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-o_8PIQENVjeLBS9hhpy01rfnjuuxUbhZUn6vf1_nE/edit?usp=sharing)
433 community-requested features and 1,267 community-reported bugs
were marked as completed in the year. Our [users pay
attention](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/247647/1438) to these
changes too. Feedback, whether encouraging or critical, reminds me
that what happens on Stack Exchange matters to the daily lives of
folks around the world. That enthusiasm and industry made 2015 our
most successful year (so far).
