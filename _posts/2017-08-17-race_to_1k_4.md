I started [this series](/tag/race_to_1k.html)
expecting to write extensively on Stack Overflow Documentation. But
sadly I had to start writing about
[shutting it down](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/354217/1438)
instead. My third post was originally going to be about a small, but
irritating edge case. Since the flaw will soon be history, I decided
to move on to more positive things about Documentation. In particular,
how it didn't really destroy Stack Overflow's reputation system the
way many assumed it would.

Now, to be fair, reputation _was_ broken
[on launch day](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/328703/addressing-documentation-repgateapocalypse). So
you might be forgiven if you assumed it was easy to make bank with
minor edits. But my experience showed it was, if anything, too
difficult to earn reputation writing Documentation. As you'll
remember, my goal was to earn 1k via Documentation contributions. And
I certainly didn't slack on the effort:

I wrote all or most of 11 examples and edited 2 more. Most[^1] of
these edits earned me +2 reputation just for getting through peer
review. However, in two months of activity, only **1 of my examples
was upvoted**. It didn't take long for me to realize I'd never get to
1k that way.  Fortunately, there are
[other ways to earn reputation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/334551/documentation-reputation-update-is-live)
from Docs, such as linking to something you contributed to in an
answer that got upvoted. But none of those reputation sources were
particularly rich either:

Reputation change | Reason
----------------: | :-----
60 | Doc Link Upvoted
20 | Proposed Change Approved
5 | Example Upvoted
-5 | Doc Rep Source Removed


In my opinion, much of the angst about reputation surfaced because of
a fundamental misunderstanding of the goal of the system. I get the
feeling that a lot of people think of reputation as either a form of
currency or a measure of talent or knowledge or skill. But listen to
how Jeff Atwood answered a listener question on
[Podcast #13](https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W13020):

Stack Overflow's reputation and badge systems are modeled after (and
themselves are) extremely successful
[token economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_economy#Basic_requirements)[^2].
Now the quote isn't about reputation, but the same principle applies:
these systems are designed to get users to come back for more. The
mechanism is simple:

1. Users post a question or an answer.
2. Other users vote on the usefulness of the post.
3. The user's reputation goes up or down based on voting.
4. Over time, reaching new reputation levels grants new privileges on
   the site.

There are a number of other nuances built into the system to encourage
and discourage other behavior, but most reputation is based on voting
on posts. So the answer to Isaac Moses question is that people who
know stuff will write useful answers which will get upvoted which
increases their reputation and gives them more say in how the site
operates. It's a virtuous cycle that gets people to do more of what
they already feel rewarded for doing.

That upvotes come from other users approving of your work magnifies
the cycle. While there's some randomness surrounding who might see
your work and when, an upvote always means someone else has vetted
your skill as a programmer and writer. Even when upvotes don't provide
reputation (such as comment upvotes), it feels fantastic to get
one. Documentation had, if anything, a more powerful system of peer
approval in that every edit required other people to review
it. Getting a change approved meant someone else had really read[^3]
what you wrote.

But Documentation utterly failed to be addictive because almost nobody
voted on examples. Maybe it was because the examples weren't useful or
because nobody saw them in the first place. Whatever the reason, no
votes means no tokens and no positive reinforcement. Ultimately, I
didn't need any Documentation reputation to reach 1k. It was a
non-factor.

[Next time](/2017/12/08/race_to_1k_5.html): I begin learning Ruby by
writing (and reading) documentation.



[^1]:

    If you edit several examples at once or if you were the last
    person to edit a topic, you only get one +2 bonus.

[^2]:

    Despite the sound of the name, token economies are not
    currencies. Unlike dollars (or, I guess, Bitcoin) you can't spend
    reputation on just anything. It's only valuable to people who have
    bought into the system in some way or another. In fact, if
    reputation ever did become fungible it would stop working
    immediately.

[^3]:

    And just to be sure, we audited reviewers by occasionally
    inserting faked junk edits. Reviewers who failed audits weren't
    allowed to review anymore.
