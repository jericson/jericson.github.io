title: What is a Community Product Manager?

After a little over 5 years since
[I started working at Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/08/09/please-welcome-jon-ericson-community-manager/),
I got a new title:

![CPM](/images/cpm.png)

It's more of a
[Assistant **to the** Regional Manager](http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Assistant_Regional_Manager)
situation than a promotion. I'm still a Community Manager, but my
title reflects our team's specialization. Some of us focus more on how
the community interacts with the product than how people in the
community interacts with each other. Those of us who think more about
the software now have the word product tacked into our titles. 

For the last few years, I've been a liaison between the rest of the
community team and a team of developers and designers working on
improving software used by our communities. First I was assigned to the
[Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation)
developers and then with
[a team named DAG](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/351751/meet-team-dag-developer-affinity-growth). I
call into their meetings, provide insight into the way the community
operates, report back to other Community Managers with any relevant
news and help communicate changes in the software to the people using
it. Doing this successfully requires understanding of several
different ways of thinking about the worlds.

Hiring an actual economist or political scientist (or even an
anthropologist) would probably be a good idea, to be honest. For
better or worse, Stack Exchange hired me instead. Still, the things I
write about often look
[a little like political science](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293213/why-we-dont-keep-public-records-of-suspensions)
and
[a little like economics](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/266696/can-we-raise-the-bar-for-reputation-for-late-answers-to-bypass-the-review-queue/267080#267080). I
still do
["digital diplomacy and conflict resolution"](https://twitter.com/anoemi/status/1100435773365604353),
of course. It's just I'm focused on _how the system itself_ can help
us do that work together with our community.

I sometimes think the job of a Community Manager is to figure out a
neat way to explain community management. The goal is clear enough:
keep an interrelated group of people (a community) healthy. That can be
accomplished by correcting bad behavior, encouraging good behavior,
crowd control, attracting new members, cleaning up messes and so on
and so forth. And we have a bunch of tools to use. The only catch is
we can't do the work alone.

I mean, we _could_ throw piles of cash at the problem to
[hire tons of moderators](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona)
who enforce
[dubious standards](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech). _Or_
we could
[radically trust our users to moderate themselves](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/). We
tread the second path, which makes the job far more complicated and
significantly more interesting.
