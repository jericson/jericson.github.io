 City of Chains uses a competent JRPG combat system to tell an "Escape from LA/NY"-style story. There are a few interesting ideas here, such as tying limited ammo to special attacks and avoiding combat by tossing a granade instead. Despite the budget graphics, this seems to be a solid game worth playing for those who enjoy this sort of story. (That said, I prefer the Shadowrun series which is more polished.)
