This is a talk I gave back on October 13, 2015 for a company meetup. I
cut out the introduction because I was super awkward. (Even compared
to what I left in.) I also cut the questions at the end as they
weren't mic'ed and I didn't repeat 'em.

[My presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1heT42e6NqhPae9m3JxryzOrtYAeR8wJapHBC7JxccUU/edit?usp=sharing)
is available if you want to see some slides I cut out. I originally
titled this talk “Crack Overflow”, but the joke requires some context
to be not unfunny. (And even then...)

Relistening to the talk, I notice I never addressed the ethical
problems with using behavioral psychology to manipulate others. For
instance, gambling can be quite harmful when people risk money they
can't afford to lose. Day-trading and certain types of in-game
purchases share that same potential for danger. More often games waste
time, which has the advantage of no easy method of
[leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). I
anticipate the coming of the
[Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/) Skinner box, but I'm
also cautious since it could easily consume time I don't want to
spend.

Stack Exchange sites avoid exploiting people for money and I feel
pretty comfortable with how most people spend their time. Still, I
worry about activities such as
[the review queues](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/251489/1438),
which perhaps over-promise the good they do. Is it really helpful to
close a question that would only get a handful of organic views and
never be answered anyway? So it's our ethical duty to avoid wasting
our users' time. That's one of the reasons I'm so happy the
[Ask Wizard has reduced the number of bad questions](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/381671/1438).
