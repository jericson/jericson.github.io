This is a talk I gave back on October 13, 2015 for a company meetup. I
cut out the introduction because I was super awkward. (Even compared
to what I left in.) I also cut the questions at the end as they
weren't mic'ed and I didn't repeat 'em.

[My presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1heT42e6NqhPae9m3JxryzOrtYAeR8wJapHBC7JxccUU/edit?usp=sharing)
is available if you want to see some slides I cut out. I originally
titled this talk “Crack Overflow”, but the joke requires some context
to be not unfunny. (And even then...)

Relistening to the talk, I notice I never addressed the ethical
problems with using behavioral psychology to manipulate others. For
instance, gambling can be quite harmful when people risk money they
can't afford to lose. Day-trading and certain types of in-game
purchases share that same potential for danger. More often games waste
time, which has the advantage of no easy method of
[leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). I
anticipate the coming of the
[Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/) Skinner box, but I'm
also cautious since it could easily consume time I don't want to
spend.

Stack Exchange sites avoid exploiting people for money and I feel
pretty comfortable with how most people spend their time. Still, I
worry about activities such as
[the review queues](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/251489/1438),
which perhaps over-promise the good they do. Is it really helpful to
close a question that would only get a handful of organic views and
never be answered anyway? So it's our ethical duty to avoid wasting
our users' time. That's one of the reasons I'm so happy the
[Ask Wizard has reduced the number of bad questions](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/381671/1438).

Networks like Twitter and Facebook are practically designed to waste
time. Last month
[I stopped using those sites](https://medium.com/@jlericson/im-giving-up-twitter-and-facebook-for-lent-fc8b07013828)
and it was honestly difficult for a few days. I woke up the first
morning wondering how many responses my post saying I was leaving had
prompted. After 40 days of not feeling angry about trivia, I don't see
myself going back. If I did, it's certain I'd be sucked back into the
trap.

At the end of the day, our network
[provides incredible value](https://stackexchange.com/about) to people
searching the internet at remarkably low cost. It's difficult to know
exactly how much time users spend asking and answering questions, but
we do know that many people enjoy sharing their knowledge. So it's a
symbiotic relationship between people who have spare time and people
who desperately needs to find knowledge. It's great that the voting
and reputation and badges and so on help users do the things they
already want to do.
