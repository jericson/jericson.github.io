This post seems to be communicating something I don't intend. What I
mean it to say is that Stack Overflow has not provided the sorts of
activities that promote the sorts of interactions
[we'd like to see](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/). Perhaps
a better explination of what I'm trying to get at can be found in
[a mroe recent post about Disneyland](/2019/06/22/disneyland.html). I'm
leaving this post here for postarity, but I ceratinly don't want
people to feel like I'm _blaming them_ of being overly harsh. In
truth, I feel this is an unindended consiquence of the system Stack
Overflow Inc. designed.

This post is inspired by
[Makoto's post on Medium](https://medium.com/@makotothedragon/dear-stack-overflow-i-really-want-to-talk-but-i-dont-believe-you-ll-listen-to-me-anymore-9b17cc9c05f6). As
I considered the conversation, I realized I needed to sit down and
think about why different members of the sites perceive content in
very different ways. My mediation got rather far afield from the exact
situation at hand, so instead of replying directly, I want to take a
hard left turn into a story that I swear will be relevant.

I listen to the Bible regularly and the reading for today[^1] was
[1<sup>st</sup> Kings&mdash;Chapter 12](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15896). It's
the part of Israel's history after
[King Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon) has died and his
son, [Rehoboam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboam), was about to
be crowned the next king. According to the story, one of Solomon's
officials, [Jeroboam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeroboam), incited
the assembly to ask the new king to reduce taxes. Rehoboam consulted
the elders, who answered:

> If you will be a servant to this people today, and you will minister
> to them and you will respond to them and speak kind words to them,
> then they will be your servants for all times.

Then he asked the young men who were his friends, who advised:

> So shall you say to this people who have spoken to you saying, 'Your
> father has made our yoke heavy, and you make it lighter for us,'
> thus shall you speak to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my
> father's loins. And now, where my father did burden you with a heavy
> yoke, I shall add to your yoke; my father flogged you with whips,
> but I will flog you with scorpions.'

Needless to say, Rehoboam took the foolish advice of his friends. When
he sent his tax collector to enforce his demands, the people stoned
him to death. The king had to escape in his chariot back to
Jerusalem. Jeroboam lead the ten tribes of Israel into rebellion and
became king of the northern kingdom.[^2] Instead of dealing with the
people harshly, speaking kind words would have won them over. But that
would not have satisfied the king's desire to demonstrate his own authority
and power.

We tend to think of the
[reputation system](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation)
as a meritocracy. When someone participates on the site, community
voting demonstrates trust, which opens up privileges to do more on the
sites. On the other hand, once people have earned
[all the privileges](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/trusted-user),
community voting stops mattering and the site functions a lot more
like an aristocracy. I put together a little chart that includes a
term I made up:[^3]

| Power structure | Authority . . .                                         |
| :-------------- | :--------------                                         |
| aristocracy     | comes from status.                                      |
| meritocracy     | is granted according to ability.                        |
| meristocracy    | comes from status that is granted according to ability. |

In many ways, "meristocracy" takes the best of both systems. It gives
agency to people who have demonstrated skill using the site _and_ are
invested in the community. That simple idea has allowed Stack
Overflow, the site, to scale at roughly the same rate as Stack
Overflow, the community. As
[Jeff Atwood put it](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/02/21/new-question-answer-rate-limits/):

> Stack Overflow is somewhat unique in that we encourage participation
> of essentially anonymous, random programmers. Our idea is to
> **radically reduce the bar for participation**, and take one giant leap
> of faith:
>
> ### Trusting our users.

Anyone can suggest an edit or ask a question just by signing up for an
account. Over the years, the developers have added
[many automatic rate limits and quality checks](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/358412/1438),
but we've resisted requests to gate participation in other ways. This
isn't purely about growing the company's business. We believe that
Stack Overflow provides more useful content when a wide variety of
people ask, answer and vote. 

But there's always been tension with radical trust and the people who
abuse it. For many years, I took regular shifts
[answering support emails](/tag/support.html). Every day we'd get
people asking for their
[question ban](https://stackoverflow.com/help/question-bans) to be
lifted. Nearly always I was glad they'd been blocked as their existing
questions were unanswerable without heroic effort and showed no sign
of improvement over time. I'm sympathetic to the idea that some people
just shouldn't be allowed to use Stack Overflow.

Perhaps we should not be surprised that users who have earned status
on the site take on the
[role of gatekeeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNnIbFFzpD8) as
well. If you haven't used the site very much, you might not see any
problem with questions like:
[What is the incentive for curl to release the library for free?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55884514/1438)
Experienced users know that most variants of that question will not be
answered by the person who made the software and will lead to
unhelpful speculation instead. So even though _this_ question got an
answer, it's not worth having the question around to set precedent.

An uncharitable way to look at the response to undeleting the question
is that it's purely a power play. I used my power as a Community
Manager to interfere with the authority of a small group of
aristocrats on the site and they responded in anger because I was
interfering with their authority to do what they like. I don't know if
this is true, but it's the story I find I'm telling myself.

A more charitable way to look at it is that we ask experienced members
of the community to enforce quality standards, we hand them a toolbox
with a variety of hammers and then we wag our fingers at them with
they use those hammers on questions. Maybe, if we want people to be
nicer to new users, we could try something else. Like, I don't know,
[mentoring](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/262292/1438).[^4] The
company likes to
[think we can solve your problems](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311933/1438),
but we're sending mixed messages at the moment.

Paradoxically, the system designed to trust users has lead to quite a
bit of mistrust. People who are just starting on their Stack Overflow
journey worry "moderators" will slap them down. People who have been
active on Stack Overflow tend to be suspicious of those who haven't
internalized the cultural norms. When they say Stack Overflow is
"becoming a forum", they mean it risks losing its essential
usefulness because of a flood of trivial nonsense.

So, of course, the two groups have come to a mutually detrimental
agreement:

* Programmers who could ask good question on Stack Overflow won't
  because they don't want to be abused. (What they don't know is that
  most of the "abuse" is really just the way the system is designed to
  protect the site from unproductive questions.)

* Long-time members of Stack Overflow assume (with good reason) that
  new questions are likely to be unanswerable or duplicate. (What they
  don't know is that many of the people who have the ability to ask
  good questions are reluctant to do so.)

When we talk to people in these groups, we find these attitudes
calcifying. And while it's been our instinct to
[tell our community to use kinder words](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/),
the real problem is we haven't maximized opportunities for people to
_be kind_ to each other.

Without necessarily being designed to do so, our meristocracy system
gives status to users who have demonstrated a commitment to
quality. Lacking other avenues to show that commitment, the ultimate
sign of status is the whole flogging with scorpions thing.
