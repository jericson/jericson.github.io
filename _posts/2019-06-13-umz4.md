Welcome to the Unicorn Meta Zoo, a podcast by members of the Stack
Exchange community team. If you want to avoid spoilers, jump
[straight to the audio][1].

### Participants

We are talking about the attributes of a healthy community.

### Links

* Our [Gardening & Landscaping](https://gardening.stackexchange.com/),
  [Puzzling](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/) and [Judaism](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/) sites.
* [Either "neesh" or "nitch" work for pronouncing niche.](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1451/neesh-or-nitch)
* ["Big Dreams, Small Spaces"](https://www.netflix.com/title/80232852)
  is on my list of shows to watch . . . eventually. I believe Abby
  refers to season 2, episode 2 "Hitchin/Worthing".
* [We exercise our communal sense of humor at least once a year.](https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/12/15/winter-bash-2014/)
* [My proof God programs in Perl.](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/55823/ptij-perl-programming-in-the-torah/55826#55826)

### Transcript

Some users have generously volunteered to transcribe episodes on
[the podcast wiki](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki). I'm
extremely grateful for users who helped fill in some of
[the previous episode's transcript](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki/How-do-we-grade-questions%3F-%5BTranscript%5D):

### Meta

This episode makes me think we need a real audio editor to get rid of
plosives. It's not an easy
[signal processing problem](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/2993/human-speech-noise-filter).

### What do you think?

[Take a listen][1] and respond in the answers below.
