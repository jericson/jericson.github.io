Recently I discovered the work of one George A Duckett who has copied
posts from all over the Stack Exchange network to produce books for
sale on Amazon. One in particular caught my eye: <a rel="nofollow"

Questions and Answers</i></a><img

(though it can be had cheaper used or via other sellers) and the
Kindle price is $3. Kindle Unlimited subscribers may read it for
free. As you might gather from the review, I think those prices are
all too expensive.

# A limited copy of material freely available elsewhere

I have some rather mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I
am an author of several of the included questions and answers. On the
other, I feel most people will be better off reading the answers
directly on the Biblical Hermeneuticsâ€”Stack Exchange site.

All user-generated content on Stack Exchange is licensed under a
Creative Commons licence (specifically CC BY-SA 3.0) that allows other
people to reuse that content. Among other things, that means anybody
can make a collection of questions and answers to publish in book
form. The two restrictions are that you must give appropriate credit
and you must distribute copies under the same licence as the
original. Unfortunately, my contributions are credited as jon-ericson,
which isn't really what I prefer. I'm not at all sure why my display
name isn't used. It's also annoying that prospective buyers can only
see samples of the material in the preview. All of it (and much more)
can be found on the Stack Exchange site.

On the topic of licences, the only indication of who owns the content
is the notice on the top and bottom of each page of the print preview
("Copyrighted Material") added by Amazon. It implies to most readers
that they should not copy the text. But the truth is copying is fine
as long as you follow the Creative Commons licence. I haven't
purchased the entire book, but it doesn't look as if the licence is
referenced. I have no idea if this fits with the letter of the law; it
certainly violates the spirit.

That said, I think there's a lot of potential value in creating a
curated copy of Biblical Hermeneutics questions and answers. Looking
at the table of contents, it's clear this volume is organized by
question tags alphabetically. If I were to publish a book like this,
I'd certainly want to use the tags, which are commonly associated with
books in the Bible or topics in hermeneutics. But I'd organize the
book tags in the order they appear in modern Bibles and put other
topics in a separate section. It very much seems as if this book was
not so much curated as copied by an algorithm. That's disappointing.

Also disappointing is the formatting. Many posts quote from other
sources, but the Kindle version of the book does a poor job of showing
where a quotation starts and ends. The preview of the print version is
a little more functional, but centered and italic text is hard to
read. Overall the typesetting (in both versions) seems
mechanical. Since it was almost certainly produced by a script, that
shouldn't have been a surprise.

The compiler of this version of the content chose to remove most of
the meta information found on the Stack Exchange site. That's a shame
because every post was scored and annotated by the community. Lacking
vote information flattens answers to be on the same footing. Not all
answers are equally useful, so it's strange to read one article that
fully and convincingly answers the question followed by a tentative
and underdeveloped answer. Typically the relative scoring would
provide the necessary context.

More aggravating is the complete lack of comments. Certainly
publishing all comments would be overkill. Many comments make sense
only in the context of the site that hosts the posts. But the reader
loses significant commentary that help clarify questions and
answers. Again, this seems to be a consequence of automation. A human
editor would find ways to include relevant commentary and omit meta
comments. But when copying content without human intervention, that's
impractical.

Reading the preview, I noticed that some of the questions are
outdated. Since the time this book was published, some material has
been edited and answers have been added. Obviously, this is a problem
with any book that fossilizes dynamic content taken from a
website. But this book compounds the problem by being very cagey about
its source. Even though there are links on every page to the Stack
Exchange site, neither the introductory material nor the back page
explain the process of obtaining the material or when it was
copied. On the contrary, the back cover of the print edition states
"If you have a question about Hermeneutics this is the book with the
answers." Wouldn't it be more helpful to point to the site those
answers come from where new questions are constantly being answered?

The real shame, however, is that George A Duckett has poisoned the
well for future entrepreneurial publishers. A well-edited collection
of questions and answers that included commentary and scoring from the
community, that used beautiful typesetting, and that truly respected
the authors of the content would be a true treasure. While it's hard
to extract from this edition, some of the answers included are
exceptional examples of Biblical interpretation and scholarship. I can
only recommend reading them in their original form and avoiding this
cynical attempt to profit from other people's work.
