[CMX](https://cmxhub.com/) recently released "[The 2021 Community
Industry Report](https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report-2021/)"
and I have thoughts. I'm gonna focus on this one
chart that summarizes Community Management in 2021:

[![What are your top frustrations about managing your community and
its
activities?](/images/cmx_2021_frustrations.png)](https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report-2021/)

I was one of the 503 people who answered "What are your top
frustrations about managing your community and its activities?" The
top 5 answers were:

1. It's hard to quantify the value of the community (45%)
2. It's difficulty to consistently engage members (43%)
3. Our efforts are largely manual and not automated (37%)
4. We don't have enough staff (28%)
5. We don't have enough budget (20%)

There are other answers, but these are the frustrations I've had as a
Community Manager too and they intertwine. So let's start with the
problem of engaging members of the community.

One of the great things about Stack Exchange is that it's not one
community, but
[multitudes](https://stackexchange.com/sites#users). Communities for
[high-level mathematicians](https://mathoverflow.net/), [people
people](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/), [literature
enthusiasts](https://literature.stackexchange.com/), [anime & manga
fans](https://anime.stackexchange.com/) and
[do-it-yourselfers](https://diy.stackexchange.com/) might share a
platform, but not cultures. Some community initiatives work better
with some groups than others. So part of the job is just figuring out
what might excite a specific group of people with a common
interest. And that means spending time getting to know those selfsame
people.

Even when we had a good understanding of the communities, it's [not
easy to predict how people will
respond](https://jlericson.com/2015/03/31/yolks_on_us.html). Community
management is, in fact, a [Dunning-Kruger
trap](https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/).[^1]
Until you've done it, you can't know how much skill it requires. [How
hard can it be?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzDYgRc6eic) You sit
around on social media, forums and chat making jokes, right?

Unfortunately, it's not always possible to cause communities to form
how or where we might want them. For instance, there were two topics
that seemed a natural fit for Stack Exchange that we just couldn't
make work: Artificial Intelligence and Startups. Both had the
novice/expert disparity problem.[^2] There were plenty of excited
amateurs and sufficient enthusiastic professionals. But the questions
tended to be [the same sort of questions people ask when they first
get interested in the
topic](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/12/23/no-artificial-intelligence-in-area-51/)
so the experts were bored giving the same answers they gave at
cocktail parties or whatnot.

After several attempts, there now is [an active AI
site](https://ai.stackexchange.com/). Robert Cartaino, who ran the
Area 51 process for forming new Stack Exchange sites, gave that
proposal a chance because AI has matured beyond its theoretical
beginnings. Questions are now firmly rooted in [techniques that
emerged from AI ivory towers](https://ai.stackexchange.com/tags). Now
that anyone can start working with neural networks, machine learning
and standardized AI libraries, there are on-ramps for the new user to
ask questions the experts want to answer.

That didn't happen with startups. Even if it had, there's no reason to
think the audience would have stuck around. My guess is people who
want to start new companies tend to move to the latest thing. I
wouldn't be surprised if questions about startups recently moved to
Clubhouse. Most likely they will soon move somewhere you and I haven't
even heard of yet. Cultivating a sustainable community often depends
on factors outside of our control.

That brings me to the top concern: how can we put a value on community
management? To answer that question, consider a hydroelectric dam.[^3]
This is perfect because I don't know how to operate a hydroelectric
dam and, unless I'm very unlucky, neither do you. I imagine when a dam
manager gets evaluated, the primary metric is how much electricity did
the plant generate and how much did it cost. The equivalent for
communities is, according to the survey, new customers and customer
retention.

![Bonneville Dam visitor center](/images/bonneville_dam.jpg)

My family visited the Bonneville Dam[^4] a couple of summers
ago. Wandering about the visitor center, it was pretty clear the
facility produces much more than electricity. I mean, it's impressive
to see a long row of generators capable of providing enough
electricity for the city of Portland,[^5] but to quote [their
website](https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/bonneville/):

> Today, the project is a critical part of the water resource
> management system that provides flood risk management, power
> generation, water quality improvement, irrigation, fish and wildlife
> habitat and recreation along the Columbia River.

That's a lot of responsibilities and it doesn't even mention the
visitor center and gift shop! At one Stack Exchange meetup the
community team tried to list all the things we do and after filling
many of those sticky poster things, we still missed a few
tasks. Having a long and diverse set of responsibilities is one way
community managers are exactly like dam managers. (I doubt that title
even exists,[^6] so hopefully nobody will disprove my assertion.)

Now suppose the executives in charge of Bonneville Dam looked a the
budget and wondered if they could save some money. "What if," these
hypothetical execs said, "we just didn't do some of the things on this
list? For instance, what if we stopped maintaining the fish ladder?
Not forever, mind you. Let's try it and see if anything breaks."

![Fish ladder viewing station](/images/fish_ladder.jpg)

Seems to me that this policy would work pretty well for quite a
while. The fish ladder mechanisms seem sturdy enough. Maybe volunteers
from the community would come out to take care of it? However, that's
not something I as a person who knows full well _I know nothing about
fish ladder maintenance_ would ever suggest. The cost of being wrong
could be catastrophic for the fish species that depend on it.

So much of community management involves doing things that don't have
an immediate benefit, but _not doing them_ could be disastrous. Or
maybe it'll be fine. Critically, nobody can truly know since
communities aren't made up of physical parts, but of human
agents. People, whatever their faults, rally around communities they
love and take care of each other. Companies can benefit from this fact
for a long time without putting much effort at all to sustain
them. Until, seemingly for no reason, the community is gone.

This gets us to the budget and staffing concerns. When companies spend
less on community, there's rarely immediate feedback other than cost
savings. This leads to a false sense that a community team reduction
leads a more efficient team. But "efficient" often means eliminating
tasks that don't have a clear or immediate purpose. At Stack Exchange,
after a round of layoffs that cut the community team by ~20%, we
decided to reduce the time we spent in chat with moderators. We were
worried that moderators would complain, but they generally seemed
accepting of our change of process.

But that change [came at a cost](/2020/04/03/pronoun_retro.html). It
just took several years for the damage to be revealed. The community
team didn't _know_ that this would happen. But we suspected it wasn't
going to be without consequences. When there are concrete cost-saving
benefits and uncertain future costs, CMs become like the prophets
confronting the kings of ancient Israel:

> And He said, "Go, say to that people:  
> 'Hear, indeed, but do not understand;  
> See, indeed, but do not grasp.'"&mdash;[Isaiah
> 6:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.9?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en)

Fortunately this is a problem many people are working on. We're
starting to see some clever ways to measure the value of
community. For instance, Richard Millington
[showed](https://twitter.com/RichMillington/status/1366347316416942080)
the community around a large tech company was saving nearly $3 million
a year in support costs. Stack Exchange can put a value on CMs
spending time chatting with moderators by adding up the cost of
[initiatives intended to restore community
trust](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/10/state-of-the-stack-community-product-q1-2021/).[^7]


Building a community is like building a hydroelectric dam: the
enormous upfront cost produces sustainable value for generations _if
well maintained_. Community professionals are being asked the wrong
question. Putting a value on a community is exactly the same as
valuing a city! The naive answer is to look at how much the city
government raises in taxes. And yet companies routinely reduce the
value of a community to the revenue they can extract from it. That
represents a fraction of the true potential value to the company to
say nothing of the value to humanity.

A better question to ask is **what do we need to invest in order to
maintain the community?** That's a question community managers are
equipped to answer. If _and only if_ you've committed to maintain the
community can you begin to explore how you can profit from the
community. It's the simple test of whether a company really puts
community first.

**Important note**: I wrote almost all of the above a few weeks back
when I was working for College Confidential. Now that [I've
left](/2021/03/18/leaving_cc.html) I should clarify a few things that
might be misunderstood:

1. Valuing community _often_ means investing more in community
   management. But some communities, especially established
   communities, can function independently. In addition, companies can
   invest in community by doing things like improving the community
   software, encouraging employees who aren't community managers to
   get involved or change their business model.
   
2. The College Confidential community is in pretty good shape for the
   moment. I admire and respect the current owners and I believe they
   will not only sustain the community, but grow it over the next few
   years.
   
3. My experience at CC gave me insight into what really helps online
   community health. It's early yet, but one of the ideas I'm
   considering is starting a consulting business that replicates the
   success I had with CC to other communities.
