I've been playing around with the [Community Notes feature on
Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/community-notes). It's an
interesting solution to moderation at scale that [relies on
humans](/2023/06/02/strike_comentary.html). For my money (and, I
guess, time) it's the most interesting thing going on the platform
right now.

As you might imagine, the Community Notes I've been asked to rate
lately have tended to involve [Hamas' terror
attack](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/praying-for-shalom/218). They
are, frankly, discouraging. Here's an example that's on the mild side:

[![Community note opining that photos of bodies do not exist because
they aren't publicly
available.](/images/community_note.png)](https://twitter.com/Jerusalem_Post/status/1712460425529372821)

Unfortunately such photos do exist[^1] and they are horrifying. But
the odd thing is that people seem to have moved the standard. Killing
innocents doesn't cease to be evil when done in a more clinical
manner. Systems of morality that encourage the killing the offspring
of the enemy exist,[^2] but modern people universally condemn these
beliefs as tribal and racist. So it's weird that otherwise civilized
people would try to justify _this_ particular murder of babies.

Only it's not at all weird. When we visited the [National Museum of
African American History and
Culture](https://www.si.edu/museums/african-american-museum) or
[Manzanar](https://www.nps.gov/manz/index.htm), I noticed I was
quietly desperate to provide context. Even this summer, when [I was
confronted](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/this-land-was-made-for-you-and-me/206)
with the injustice my country did against native Americans, I wanted
to find any way of reducing my horror of our history. It's not a
conscious choice, but an instinctual rebellion against dealing with
feelings of guilt.

Bayesian statistics offers one way to think about the phenomenon via
[prior
probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability). Let's
take a (hopefully) uncontroversial example:

* A few days ago my wife and I started shopping for tickets on the
  Alaska Airlines website.
* The next day I got an email from Alaska Airlines offering me miles if I
  applied for a credit card and used it to buy tickets.
* What are the odds I got the email _because_ Alaska noted we were
  looking for tickets a few days ago?
  
Well, it depends a lot on what I think the odds are that I'd have
received the email offer if we _hadn't_ started pricing tickets. Since
I don't remember seeing an email like this in the past, I assume the
odds are quite low. If I only get a few emails, say, once a quarter,
then it's a lot more suspicious than if I get them every day. And
everyone _knows_ Google/Amazon/Apple has their digital spies
everywhere so that they can sell your data to companies like Alaska
Airlines.

Let's do a quick search of my email:

![Frequent emails from Alaska Airlines](/images/alaska_bayes.png)

Well. Not only do I get many emails from Alaska Airlines, I got nearly
identical offers on October 4 and September 13. So much for my
hypothesis that searching for tickets caused Alaska to send me that
email. I also unsubscribed from the Alaska Airlines mailing list.

If you identify with a group in some way or another, you're likely to
think people in that group are generally good and reasonable
people. One bit of evidence will have a really hard time changing that
belief. Indeed, it might [paradoxically increase your positive
feelings about that group](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe). So
new evidence [rarely changes the way people
think](/2021/03/27/change_your_mind.html) about prior beliefs.

When I worked at Stack Exchange, I took [an implicit bias test that my
boss
recommended](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/).[^3]
Like many people I learned I'm unconsciously biased against women and
people with dark skin. Then I tried to use that knowledge to change my
behavior. What I found is that I might have a bias for a fraction of a
second when I meet someone for the first time based on skin color and
gender, which is what the test measures, but I very quickly overcome
that bias in the following minutes when I get to know
someone. Implicit bias for most people is a very weakly held prior
that quickly becomes overcome by evidence.

The LA Times published a story titled, ["Stanford scientist, after
decades of study, concludes: We donâ€™t have free
will"](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-10-17/stanford-scientist-robert-sapolskys-decades-of-study-led-him-to-conclude-we-dont-have-free-will-determined-book). My
immediate thought was "No he didn't!" It's a logical impossibility
because if his conclusion is true he can't conclude anything at
all. It's just the result of random firings of neurons in his
brain. If so, why should we trust his conclusion over anyone else's?
Surely he must carve out a tiny island of free will for his book to
stand on. Of course, "We don't have as much free will as we think we
do" doesn't grab the reader in quite the same way.

So I'm not sure our subtle implicit biases matter much. Because of [my
upbringing](/2015/04/22/cs_females.html) I might instinctively favor
some people over others based on superficial qualities. I can't argue
that I should avoid acting on those instincts. However any change I
make in that respect will be marginal at best. No, I'm much more
worried about my biases that everyone except me is aware of. Those are
the patterns of thinking that will lead me down the wrong path even
when I'm faced with overwhelming evidence that I'm wrong.

Last year I created a [Politics
Forum](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/politics-discussion-group/3617248)
on College Confidential. It has been a success if judged solely by the
decrease in contentious political discussions on the main site. It
still has contentious discussions in the private forum
though. Recently I conducted a poll of members of the Politics Forum
and found we had a significant bias as defined by who people voted for
in 2020:


Candidate    | CC politics forum | Popular vote
:--------    | ----------------: |------------:
Biden        |               74% |        51.3%
Trump        |               12% |        46.9%
Someone else |               10% |         1.9%
Did not vote |                4% |          -

This is not a real surprise. Our top cities by visitors are:

1. New York
2. Los Angeles
3. Chicago
4. Loudoun County, Virginia
5. Dallas
6. Boston
7. San Jose

You get the idea. Mostly large cities that almost exclusively voted
for Biden. Plus our audience is primarily interested in higher education which

[^1]: Of course there are Community Notes arguing over whether those
    images were computer-generated or altered. It strikes me as
    plausible that someone would do this. I've also seen horrific
    images of children being rescued from bombed out buildings that
    turned out to be from a 2016 Syrian attack near Aleppo. Kinda
    illustrates [the doctrine of Total
    Depravity](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/utter-depravity)
    if you ask me.
    
[^2]: For instance [Psalm 137:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+137/)
    advocates the murder of the children of Babylonian occupiers of
    Israel:

        Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones
          and dashes them against the rock!

    My [Psalm a Day podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/psalm-a-day/id1535678097) ended before I rached 137 (I do hope to start it up again soon!) so I don't have complete thoughts on this conclusion. I will say that the entire book of Psalms lives in the complicated world of emotion. It's not the sort of thing you can apply to your life without introspection.
