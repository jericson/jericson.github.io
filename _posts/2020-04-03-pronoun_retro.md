Because of the nature of [Stack Overflow's agreement with Monica
Cellio](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio),
there is realistically no chance the company will respond to this
speculation. I wrote obliquely about a retrospective in a [Twitter
thread about
accountability](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1230268701510733824.html). After
thinking about this for over a month, I believe it important to tell
my version of the story in more detail. Obviously there is a
temptation to promote myself and provide salacious content. But I also
think many Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange contributors have been
harmed. The company that manages those communities and the content
they create needs to be held accountable to the public for the same
reason we regulate utilities. Their incentives must be aligned with
beneficiaries of the service.

A few disclaimers:

* I'm not using any notes, but only my memory of events from months
  and even years in the past. My memory is both fallible and prone to
  bias.
  
* I'm sympathetic to the view that authors be allowed to use the
  language they feel comfortable using. I would urge authors to use
  pronouns other people request as a matter of courtesy. I have
  adopted the use of singular "they/them" in my own writing, but I
  don't think that should be required of others.
  
* While I have talked with people who are transitioning away from the
  gender they were born into, I don't have any real understanding of
  their life experience. I take them at their word when they explain
  what they are going through. I believe them when they explain the
  harm that is done by people misusing pronouns.
  
* Most of the events I describe are second or third hand. I wasn't
  very much involved in this situation until near the end. 
  
So I'm not exactly the best source for this except I'm free to speak
about what I observed.

The story starts several years ago in the Teachers' Lounge chatroom
where Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow moderators can talk with each
other. There is some business that occurs in the TL, but much of the
conversation is whatever is on the minds of the moderators who happen
to be there. The chat platform is a product the company developed
based on [Campfire chat](https://basecamp.com/retired/campfire). It is
easily my favorite chat system, but it [runs into moderation
problems](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/311540/request-for-community-attention-on-a-moderators-behavior/311548#311548)
when the number of active users exceeds a few dozen.[^1]

Moderators on Stack Exchange sites tend to be particularly adept at
navigating social dynamics, but as the network grew, so did the
potential TL membership. I don't have access to the data, but from the
time [I joined in
2012](https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/posts/148/revisions)
the activity in the TL increased substantially. Meanwhile, the
[community team
shrank](https://meta.stackexchange.com/posts/99341/revisions). Since
CMs are _de facto_ moderators of the moderators, that meant the
potential for toxic behavior increased. For a variety of reasons,
fewer of the CMs (including myself) remained active in the chatroom.

A few years ago a small number of moderators started telling the
community team that they were feeling uncomfortable in the TL. I'm
afraid I was not sympathetic at all. I hadn't yet realized the
potential danger and I considered the TL to be entirely optional for
moderators. If someone was having a problem in moderator chat, it was
probably their own issue and they can just stay away. Fortunately
other CMs took the moderators more seriously.

One of the issues that came up was that some moderators requested
specific pronouns that other moderators didn't use. Part of the
problem is there was no easy way for people to provide preferred
pronouns besides telling each other in conversation. So it was easy to
use the wrong pronoun unintentionally. There was also inherent
disagreement between people requesting "they/them" and others who did
not want to use them. And there was at least one incident where a
moderator made a very hurtful comment about transgender people.

To be clear, this was not the only problem brewing. None of the
moderation tools of chat worked for a moderator-only room and
discussions did get heated from time to time. If it weren't pronouns,
I'm confident some other disagreement would have boiled over
eventually. For the last few years, chat has been utterly abandoned by
Stack Overflow leadership since the company moved to Slack for
internal communications.[^2] So there was no will to improve
moderation tools on chat.

Other CMs specifically raised the issue of pronouns with
leadership. It seemed like something we'd need to address in the [Code
of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct). Nothing really
happened at that point, if I recall. Sometime after that, a moderator
posted a question in the moderator-only Q&A about using preferred
pronouns. I answered that question as did other CMs.[^3] My answer
tried to thread the needle between various conflicting positions, as
is my wont. Much later in the process, I deleted the answer since it
conflicted with the company's eventual decision. I was fine with that;
one of my preferred [conflict resolution
strategies](https://theparticipationcompany.com/2016/06/5-conflict-resolution-strategies/)
is compromise.

The employees most active in the TL (mostly CMs or former CMs)
continued to mediate between moderators. But the conflict continued to
surface. Around the time [the community team changed
leadership](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/325178/goodbye-and-thank-you-jaydles/325544#325544),
CMs asked again for guidance. Months later we learned that some people
in leadership put this request on their agenda, but failed to follow
through. Over the summer [I went on
sabbatical](https://jlericson.com/2020/02/02/2019_in_review.html) so I
don't have any first-hand knowledge of that time. I later learned that
moderators were (understandably) frustrated by our lack of progress
clarifying the CoC.

Months passed with no movement. My understanding at the time was the
company held a philosophy of [servant
leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). We used
to joke that people had been "demoted to manager". Leaders were
expected to listen to their people and give them agency. There was
a concept of "decisions as a service" in which a leader might resolve
a disagreement by making a decision in order to allow
progress. Implicit in this concept was the understanding that leaders
might make the wrong decision and be required to change their
minds. And so I felt a degree of relief when someone in leadership
stepped in to make a decision.

While I thought the initial statement in the TL was more aggressive
than I would have preferred, it did seem like a reasonable
decision. Unfortunately, it was somewhat ambiguous.[^4] It turns out
the intention was _even more forceful_ than my reading. Unfortunately,
the person who made the statement logged off of chat (both the TL and
the internal chat systems) for the weekend and did not respond to
repeated requests (both from moderators and CMs) to clarify. This
created so much confusion that the conflict among moderators greatly
increased.

At this point it became clear the normal tools for chat moderation
were useless when moderators needed moderating. In the end, CMs simply
shut down the room and created a script to automatically prevent
moderators from speaking there so that the CMs could get some
rest. The weekend after that was a near carbon copy except that Monica
Cellio had been forcibly removed from her moderator positions. Again,
the people who made this decision on a Friday afternoon abandoned the
CMs to deal with the fallout _sans_ direction.[^5]

It should be clear this is not the model of servant leadership. I
pleaded with many people up and down the chain of command who ought to
have had authority to step in. None were willing _and_ able to do
so. Both moderators and CMs were kept in the dark. While we were
scrabbling for information and guidance, our leaders were [talking to
The
Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/01/stack_exchange_controversy/). Moderators
began resigning in protest and the CMs had no answers. We didn't know
what was going on or how leadership intended to answer.

This has _not_ been a blameless retrospective. I blame a failure of
leadership within the company for the problems it has had with the
community. I mentioned [Conway's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) in [my going-away
post](https://jlericson.com/2020/01/17/leaving_stack.html). The idea
is that the product of an organization reflects its internal
communication structure. Creating that structure is the job of an
organization's leadership. In many ways, it's the only job leaders
have.

For the first time in my career, I find myself leading a small
team. I've carved out some community management work for myself in
much the same way programmers try to keep coding as they move into
management positions. But the rest of my job is meetings and Jira
tickets and emails and [pulling information out of DMs into
channels in
Slack](https://jlericson.com/2020/03/09/remote_tips.html). In other
words, I'm working to open up communication paths between the people
doing the work.

Stack Overflow leaders worked to close down communication paths
in 2019. I sent so many emails to leaders that (as far as I can tell)
were piped into `/dev/null`. Community Managers were forbidden to
discuss things in public for legal reasons. We were [instructed not to
use our primary medium of communication with the
community](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/30/the-loop-march-2020/). I
can't know for certain, but **I believe the primary motivation was
shame**. I see evidence that Stack Overflow leadership is ashamed of
the way their peers see the community. They would like to distance
themselves from contributors to the site who are perceived, in
certain circles, as sexist, racist, homophobic or transphobic.

It seems _so_ easy to just tell those people to go away. The company
can simply remove access, if they desire. If only it were [that
straightforward](https://jlericson.com/2020/03/30/sourdough.html). What
leadership failed to consider is that Monica Cellio is not
transphobic.[^6] This would not have been difficult to figure out if
leadership had simply picked up the phone to talk to her. I did that
in the week leading up to her firing. I may disagree with her grammar
standards, but she is no bigot.

With the lens of shame, the actions of leadership start to make more
sense. Why the burst of activity after months of inaction? Perhaps it
was the fear [the incoming
CEO](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/24/announcing-stack-overflows-new-ceo-prashanth-chandrasekar/)
would hold leaders accountable? Perhaps they had forgotten people were
waiting for them? Perhaps they believed their orders had been ignored
by the CMs? Whatever the case, people who are ashamed of their actions
(and inactions) naturally want to hide their shame.

As the title says, this is a _one-sided_ retrospective. There have
been changes to leadership since I left. It's possible the culture is
changing for the better. I see from the product updates that parts of
the company are _trying to do the right thing_. I'm glad; sincerely
I'm grateful for the good faith attempts I see to repair the
damage. For what it's worth, I mostly agree with
[Meg](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/345734/feedback-for-the-loop-march-2020/345755?noredirect=1#comment1158303_345755):

But this is my retrospective and I can't get over feelings of
disappointment, anger, frustration, cynicism and, yes, shame. The
company I wanted Stack Overflow to be (and thought it was) would not
take a year to listen to what the people most active with the
community were saying.[^7] Here's hoping for a better 2020.[^8]



[^1]: I strongly suspect the there is an analog to [Dunbar's
    number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) at
    play. After a certain point, it becomes impossible to keep track
    of all the interconnecting relationships in a group.
	
[^2]: Among the many missed business opportunities must be counted the
    failure to turn chat into a paid product. For years leadership
    said chat could never be profitable. Once Slack proved them wrong,
    they said we could never compete because we were so far behind. I
    can't prove them wrong, but I think [Discord
    did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)). Exactly
    why the company failed to see the potential of chat is a story for
    another day.
	
[^3]: I do have access to that site and the answers, but following the
    conceit of this post, I'm going from memory for this bit of the
    story too.

[^4]: In a straw poll taken during the retrospective, roughly half the
    participants read the statement differently than I did. The other
    half agreed with my interpretation. Given we were employees with
    greater access to the decision process, there is little reason to
    expect the moderators to have understood the statement's intent.

[^5]: I also avoided chat for those two weekends. I don't know if it
    would have made any difference, but it was largely acting out of
    cowardice. I felt I should speak up, but I was afraid.

[^6]: For instance, she [donated almost $8k to The Trevor
    Project](https://www.cellio.org/trevor-letter.png) that was left
    over from [her GoFundMe
    campaign](https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2071780.html). Meanwhile,
    the [Gives Back
    program](https://stackoverflow.blog/?s=gives+or+giving) was
    delayed last year because Robert Cartaino, the owner of that
    project, was fired. (I'm done with the "let go" doublespeak.) Even
    before he left, there was push back from leadership for what was
    billed as financial reasons. Given the tax benefits companies reap
    from charitable giving, I wonder if the real problem was the
    program's connection to moderators. But perhaps that's
    uncharitable of me.

[^7]: It's not clear to me that leadership is listening to the
    Community Managers even today.
	
[^8]: Here's my new worry: 2020 is shaping up to being a really bad
    environment for Stack Overflow's business. At College
    Confidential, we saw a notable decrease in traffic and advertiser
    interest in March. Even in the tech sector, I imagine hiring is
    going to be slow for a while. And as useful as private Q&A can be,
    I suspect companies are going to invest in video conferencing and
    chat first. Historically the community has taken the back seat
    when times of financial stress arrive.
