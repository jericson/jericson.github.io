_This is part of an ongoing series. Read [the first entry](/2017/07/26/race_to_1k_1.html) for context._

Most people coming to Stack Overflow who don't know much about a tag
are passive consumers. A small percentage
([of a huge number](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/358412/1438))
will ask a question. People tend to assume only experts should answer,
but I think
[answering is a good way to learn](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/304135/1438). My
hope for Documentation was that it'd be an even easier way to learn
via Stack Overflow. (I was
[wrong](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).)
To test that theory, I figured I might as well use ignorance of Ruby
to my advantage.

Documentation had a great feature where people could ask for someone
else to write a topic. Knowing almost nothing about Ruby, I didn't
know what was lacking in the Documentation, so I was excited to see
[art-solopov](https://stack-overflow.com/users/2733119/art-solopov)'s
request:

Indeed, this was a useful request since the
[official documentation](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/trunk/OptionParser.html)
includes these amusing notes:

> The following example is a complete Ruby program. You can run it and
> see the effect of specifying various options. This is probably the
> best way to learn the features of `optparse`.

So, yeah. The official documentation isn't great _and knows it_. It's
not helped that command line syntax is kinda standardized
haphazardly. Over the years a bunch of conventions have accumulated
that a sophisticated program really needs to observe. Each language
offers a unique method to parse the command line, but it's tedious to
document everything in detail. 

Perl's
[`Getopt::Long` module](https://perldoc.perl.org/Getopt/Long.html) has
excellent documentation that goes into detail. It's how I learned to
parse the command line and it made coming to Ruby's sparse
documentation less painful. I can't imagine someone who has to learn
everything from scratch getting anywhere with it. So I wrote an
`OptionParser` topic, submitted it for review and made Kathryn's first
contribution to Stack Overflow.


[![My first review!](/images/first-review.png)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170825204156/https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/review/changes/138724)

You can
[read the topic on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170816212700/https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/ruby/9860/optionparser#t=201708162127003044703). To
be honest, it's not spectacular. At some point, Ruby added a built-in
why to specify
[required arguments](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/trunk/OptionParser.html#class-OptionParser-label-Required+Arguments),
which invalidates one of my examples. I'm not really convinced it
would actually help anyone who didn't have a working knowledge of
command line syntax. But it was a start and writing it helped me to
understand how the Ruby module works. I also got 2 points of
reputation and my first substantial badge:

![My achievements!](/images/first-awards.png)

At Stack Exchange, we spend a lot of time thinking about badges and
reputation notifications. For the first contribution to the site, you
are certain to get at least a bronze badge. We also notify folks of
upvotes (but not necessarily downvotes), which encourages people to do
more of whatever it was they did to get an upvote. This is all
[basic behavioral psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement)
and it works brilliantly.

After getting this little burst of reinforcement, I wanted more. So I
decided to
[search for `optparse` questions](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=active&q=%5bruby%5d%20OptParse%20is%3aquestion)
to answer with my new-found knowledge:

* [Force mandatory command line argument using OptionParse in Ruby](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18992843/force-mandatory-command-line-argument-using-optionparse-in-ruby/43728421#43728421)
* [List of arguments in OptParse without separator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35460060/list-of-arguments-in-optparse-without-separator/43729400#43729400)
* [Optparse doesn't seem to return ARGV array. Argument Required Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26854063/optparse-doesnt-seem-to-return-argv-array-argument-required-error/43729801#43729801)
* [How to best wrap Ruby optparse code and output?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29229059/how-to-best-wrap-ruby-optparse-code-and-output/43748757#43748757)

And so began a pattern of writing a bit of documentation and then
poking around to find questions I could answer with new-found
knowledge. Documentation rewarded this behavior by offering an extra 5
reputation points for the first upvote of an answer linking to a topic
or example I contributed to. As I answered questions, I also noticed
problems in the documentation (both the official stuff and the topics
I'd authored). So I'd use _that_ discovery to edit my topics. It was a
very productive feedback loop; at the end of one day I had earned 37
reputation.

The bulk of my 1k reputation came from answering questions based on
Ruby features I just learned
about. [Very little came](/2017/08/17/race_to_1k_4.html) from writing
documentation directly. But by picking very narrow features of Ruby, I
can productively find questions I'm uniquely suited to answer.
