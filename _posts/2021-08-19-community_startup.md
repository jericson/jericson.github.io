Ever wonder how communities start? In a way it's not hard to explain:
people meet other people who share something in common and then, well,
they become a community. But if your goal is to cause communities to
form, than it's not clear how to make that happen. And it's even
harder to make communities form around a particular interest such as
your company and its products. Turns out you can't really force people
to meet each other and even if you did, that wouldn't necessarily
cause a self-sustaining community to form.

I worked for a while on what you might call a community incubator. We
took topic ideas and turned them into functional communities. I'm
talking about Stack Exchange, which currently has [177
communities](https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#questionsperday). 80%
of those sites get, on average, 1 or more questions a day. That might
not sound like a lot, but that's a very respectable track record. 

Now that's a bit of a cheat because [sites are sometimes shut
down](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/368111/what-is-the-largest-stack-exchange-website-that-got-shut-down). By
my count, 47 sites were shut down. So the success rate is closer to
60%. Still not bad. When you consider that many of the sites that get
less than one question a day (on average) are still viable, if
low-activity, communities, we could redefine success to get back to
~80%. 

Unfortunately we still haven't accounted for Area 51, which is ["the
Stack Exchange Network staging
zone"](https://area51.stackexchange.com/faq).[^1] Area 51 gets tons of
proposals and huge percentage are [closed within 3
days](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20966/minimum-activity-requirements-for-area-51). Of
the ones that remain, very few make it past the rigorous "Definition"
phase and even fewer gather enough support in "Commitment" phase to
even get a chance to fail in the "Beta" phase. Since proposals are
deleted once they run out of time, I'd need access to Stack Exchange's
internal database to know how many fail, but the success rate is almost
certainly a fraction of a percent.

That's not the only way to think about it, of course. Ideas are cheap
and [most of the sites
proposed](https://web.archive.org/web/20111223094921/http://area51.stackexchange.com/?tab=newest&page=1&pagesize=50)
on Area 51 had no chance to begin with.[^2] Better for these sites to
fail in the staging environment rather than after resources have been
allocated to build the actual sites. In fact, [Robert
Cartaino](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/98786/robert-cartaino)
designed Area 51 to screen out ideas that sounded good on paper, but
wouldn't work as a real community. The model he designed can be used
to maximize the success of any community whether on Stack Exchange or
not. So let's examine it more closely.

## Definition

Let's suppose you want to start [a site about
gardening](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1369?phase=definition). Seems
simple enough. Everyone knows what gardening is, right? But what about
landscaping? Is it ok to talk about that in a gardening community? How
about indoor plants? What about bees and other pollinators? What about
fixing fences? Other home repair? Should plumbing questions be limited
to sprinkler systems or all types of household plumbing? Believe it or
not, these are important questions to answer upfront.

Area 51 requires followers to submit at least 40 on-topic example
questions with a net score of at least 10. These aren't intended to be
answered, but rather to show what sort of question the beta site might
host after it launched. For gardening, it's [questions
like](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1369/gardening-and-landscaping?tab=votes&phase=definition#tab-top):

* How deep should I plant tomatoes?
* How to make clay soils better?
* Is there a lawn mowing strategy (long/short) (more frequent/less
  frequent) that is advantageous to controlling lawn weeds?
* I just bought a plant that needs a higher pH soil than my house
  has. How can I change the acidity (pH level) of my soil?
* What should I spray on the little bugs on the back of my leaves? (I
  am told they are aphids.)

Those are good questions because people who are interested in
gardening might ask them. You can see that the focus is solidly on
growing plants. If that includes you, great! It might _exclude_ people
too and, insofar as that's [something groups necessarily
do](https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2005-shirky-agroupisitsownworstenemy.pdf),
that's helpful too. As tempting as it is to make the scope of the
community broad enough that anyone can feel welcome, successful groups
have narrower scopes than most outsiders would intuit.

For instance, gardeners consider a question like "My patio is covered
with ants. How can I kill them?" a question about pest control rather
than gardening. Unless these are [leafcutter
ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant) attacking plants,
a true gardener isn't worried about them. In contrast, they are quite
concerned about aphids, which destroy plants. This distinction might
not seem important to outsiders, but it does matter to the
group. There might even be people in the group opposed to killing
ants, which serve a purpose in the ecosystem of a garden. Allowing
that "perfectly reasonable" question could drive away valuable
experts.

## Commitment

There's a lot more we could say about defining the scope of a proposed
community, but let's move on to the commitment phase. Remember how I
said communities form when people gather together? Well the commitment
phase is [Stack Exchange's answer to the empty restaurant
problem](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/07/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/). Instead
of opening the doors and hoping people walk in off the street, Area 51
won't even open a <strike>restaurant</strike> site until 200 people
have committed to come.[^3] That way when the
<strike>restaurant</strike> site opens, people will see other people
there on day one.

Now some percentage of people commit to participate during beta and
never show. Participation often drops off in the weeks and months
following the start of beta as people get bored or decide the site
isn't for them. That's honestly fine. The goal of commitment is less
to tie people down to participate and more to make sure there's a
critical mass to get started. As long as a reasonable percentage make
an effort, the site will have its best chance at success.

Another option that Stack Overflow used when it first launched was a
waitlist. Like [Gmail](https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/)
and [later
Spotify](https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/13/spotify-launching-8am-tomorrow-open-pre-registered-users/),
the idea is that people will value their invitation to a greater
degree when there is perceived scarcity. Unlike waiting until enough
people commit, people wait until the site owners grant them
entrance. Of course, you better have something amazing to reward the
wait in the end or risk disappointment.

## Beta

Even with the right site definition and plenty of committed users,
communities sometimes fail to gain traction. Maybe I should say
"often" rather than "sometimes". Just bringing people together doesn't
mean they will continue gather. There needs to be a reason for people
to come back. And that means _content_.

[![Crowd at the Hollywood Bowl.](/images/hollywood_bowl.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Bowl)

If you go to a concert, you probably come for music, not the
audience. That's what happens with online communities too. If
anything, other people must be endured. Once the venue stops hosting
music you care about, you'll think nothing of doing something else with
your evening. It's all about content.

But you might notice other people who seem to have a different, or
maybe deeper, draw. The couple a row or two in front of you flag down
a friend finding their way to their seat. The guy behind you knows all
the lyrics to every song and proves it by singing (badly) into your
ear. You see tour shirts from other continents. This is the part of
the community that, in a sense, transcends the content, which is the
only way a community can sustain itself.

To illustrate I have a friend who continued to buy Chargers season
tickets years after he stopped caring about football. You see, his
wife had so many friends who also had season tickets it felt like a
betrayal to give them up. These fans probably would have been just as
happy if the Chargers stopped playing the games. For some people, the
community _is_ the content. Getting there, even on a small scale,
takes time and a well designed community experience. Quality content
is a prerequisite for a self-sustaining community.

Stack Exchange takes advantage of its established community culture
and design. A new community is a Q&A site with attached meta and
chat. While newcomers don't immediately experience it, Stack Exchange
(including Stack Overflow) can be a comfortable environment. That's a
huge advantage that most community startups won't have. Even so, Stack
Exchange betas fail if people don't show up and ask interesting
questions. Nothing can take the place of quality content to get a
community started.

These days there's no reason to build new community software. I'm a
big fan of [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) for long-form
content and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for chat.[^5] Selecting a
modern, flexible and fully-featured platform only makes a comfortable
space available. It doesn't get people to come or, just as important,
to stay. This is why, if you depend on members of the community to
supply content, you'll want them to arrive at about the same time so
that they can interact with each other.

Like any new establishment, you'll want to start with a vision of what
the community will be. But as people come and [rearrange the
chairs](https://horyun.design/docs), you'll need to adjust. Most likely
a few of the boundaries marked out the definition phase will need to
be moved. Likely some of the decisions about the design of the
platform will turn out to be hindering more than they help. It's
critical that the people managing the community adjust to the new
mental models of reality the nascent group presents. There's no script
for this.

Footnotes:

[^1]: Stack Exchange has a site sponsorship program. Once we invited
    NASA to sponsor one of our sites. Probably [Space
    Exploration](https://space.stackexchange.com/), but my memory is a
    bit fuzzy on that point. Unfortunately, someone at NASA noticed we
    had a site called Area 51 that was decorated with whimsical aliens
    and decided they wanted nothing to do with us.

[^2]: I once proposed a site (called [Framed
    Garbage](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122249/building-an-archive-of-deleted-questions/136261#136261))
    to serve as an archive for all the deleted question on other
    sites. Not so much a community as a very specific clone of the
    [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

[^3]: There's also a "commitment score", which takes into account,
    among other things, the ratio of users with experience using the
    Stack Exchange network. If too few people committed to the
    proposal know how the system works, the site is likely to fail. So
    most proposals require something more than 200 people to commit
    before it can pass into beta.

[^4]: It can also give the operators of the site time to scale
    up. This won't be a factor for the vast majority of communities
    these days. It's just a lot harder to find more people eager to
    join than to find computer resources to handle the load.

[^5]: In case you are wondering, yes, it is confusing to recommend two
    products with similar names. What's worse, is I _don't_ recommend
    [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), which is a blog comment
    platform. [Discourse serves that role well and
    inexpensively.](https://jlericson.com/2021/04/06/oracle_discourse.html)
