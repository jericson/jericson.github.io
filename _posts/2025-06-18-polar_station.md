The _Exit_ series are escape-rooms-in-a-box featuring riddles that
must be completed under time pressure. Nothing prevents solo play,
but, like an escape room, they are designed for a small group of
friends who bring different ways of thinking. It's also a
single-play-only game since players will literally spoil the puzzles.

Reviewing such a game comes with unique challenges. Generally games
need more than a single session to evaluate. Not only do some games
unfold their secrets only after several plays, you gotta beware of
letting an especially pleasant or disagreeable experience bias your
conclusion. Puzzle games come with the added complication of the
Goldilocks paradox of difficulty. Solutions that come too easily don't
satisfy and neither do puzzles that resist too much. Ideally your
brain will be taxed _just enough_ to be interesting without needing to
read the help cards. Unfortunately every group will have a different
level of _just right_ and I can't know where your level might be.

_The Polar Station_ puts your team on a research station near the
North Pole when something terrible happens. Fortunately help is
coming. Unfortunately, you'll need to open a series of containers in
order to find the code that will open the door to exit. My daughter
enjoyed the story at the start, but the focus shifts to puzzles pretty
quickly. Each fits well into the overall theme, but there's no time to
read lore until the very end. 

I played with my children: 10-year-old twins and my college-age
son. We read the rules together and while the mechanism for opening
each lock was quite involved, none of us had difficulty understanding
it. Each lock opens when you enter the right combination of three
digits into a '90's-style DRM code wheel, consult the card that
matches the revealed number and cross-reference the object you are
attempting to unlock to index a second card. Unlocking containers
opens up more clue cards and sometimes a new component. It's easier to
manage than it sounds.

Without spoiling any of the riddles, you can immediately disassemble
the booklet that's included in the starting inventory. The game
suggests a max of 4 players with the primary limitation being access
to clues. Since the game starts with just the code wheel and the
booklet, the first riddle involves clue congestion as everyone tries
to examine the booklet at the same time. Even after getting more
clues, the booklet remains the critical piece of most puzzles. You're
going to cut out pages by the end of the game, so why not spread out
the material from the start?

Having the freedom to destroy components means the designers could
stretch puzzles in unusual directions. It also means you can
accidentally destroy a clue in the process of attempting to solve
it. We ended up needing a solution for one riddle for that
reason. (With a bit of tape I was able to see how the puzzle works
after we'd finished our escape.) If we'd avoided our mistake, I
suspect this riddle would have been a highlight. A little more
instructional text might have prevented our mistake without harming
the crux of the riddle.

After an hour, the younger half of our group wandered off. Around that
point, the riddles tipped over into the frustrating category for
us. Good puzzle game design gives players several puzzles to work on
so that you can make progress on other problems while stuck an a
particularly tricky problem. Some riddles need to marinate in the back
of your mind for awhile. _The Polar Station_ is surprisingly linear,
however. I believe we maxed out at three simultaneously-open riddles
and needed to check the solution of all three.

Taking help cards counts against the final score _only if they provide
new information_. The first help card tells players which clues and
components are used, but we didn't normally need that help. We
sometimes _were_ helped by the second help card, but not enough to
actually solve the riddles. As we neared the 2 hour mark, [ego
depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion) kicked in,
which meant we were in a particularly poor mental state to solve the
riddles. Meanwhile, we'd also reached the hardest riddles in the game.

Thankfully the final few riddles were easier to solve and we escaped
our polar prison. Whenever you finish, the story ends the same
way. For people familiar with a particular cultural artifact, the
narrative is wholly predictable, which is fine given the inventive
riddles at the heart of the game. Since the game ended on riddles in
our Goldilocks zone, we had a satisfying escape.

I only noticed after we finished that there is a helper app for this
title that provides a tutorial and a timer with ambient sounds.  The
rule book said the app also includes three bonus riddles, but I don't
know where they might be. 

Taken as a whole, _The Polar Station_ comes together as a
professionally developed experience for a bargain price. This is
perhaps more difficult than the 3/5 level printed on the box
implies. Again, this is group dependent and I haven't tried any other
entry in the series.
