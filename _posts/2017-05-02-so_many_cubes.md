 The premise of launching cubes in hopes of destroying the enemy pole/base is a good one. But the execution is not great. Most of the launchers are just random, but there's one that fires straight and true: the minigun. It's basically the only thing you ever need to build. Put it in front of your pole and you'll never lose. Enemy cubes that threaten your base get shot up and all the leftover bullets take down the enemy. There's only one winning strategy and everything else is (almost literally) a roll of the dice.
 

 

 In addition, the interface is off and there's too much waiting around for the currency system to let you build stuff. I guess these sorts of problems are to be expected with early access. But it doesn't seem like it'll be fixed anytime soon. Even if it is fixed, I think the game mechanics are too broken to be worth playing.
