title: My answer about using preferred pronouns

Below is a lightly edited answer I wrote on the Stack Exchange
moderator private Q&A on January 17 2019. The next day I added the
section that begins "It's been pointed out to me..." to clarify. I
deleted the answer on October 7 2019 because it seemed more likely to
add confusion to ongoing events. I'm sharing this answer because it
adds some context to the [history of events on Stack
Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/354978/responding-to-the-lavender-letter-and-commitments-moving-forward/355520#355520). 

In retrospect, I still agree with all the points I made, but I think
my answer still missed the mark. People were hurting because they felt
unheard. My answer was, in effect, "stop talking about this". There is
no way that wouldn't cause further pain and I apologize to the people
my words harmed. (I don't exactly know who that might be,
unfortunately. One of the destructive things about this situation is
that people most hurt often felt least empowered to speak up.)

I should also point out that community managers much more qualified
then me took up the question. By all rights, that should have begun a
process to resolve the differences and create peace. If the CMs had
been given the authority to do that, I believe that is what would have
happened. Instead, management asserted responsibility and blocked
progress for months. And when management finally did act . . . [it
went poorly](/2020/04/03/pronoun_retro.html). I worry this answer made
the situation worse.

A good deal of effort has gone into obscuring the sequence of
events. Some of that is justified because so many of the events
occurred in the Teachers' Lounge (TL), a private chat room for
moderators. But some of the secrecy has served to confuse
observers. There's not a whole lot I can do about it other than
publish the bits I'm responsible for. So that's what I'm doing
here. My answer to whether people should be be required to use
preferred pronouns for the sake of posterity:

Many years ago, I read [_Metamagical
Themas_](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465045669) by
Douglas Hofstadter. It included an essay entitled "Changes in Default
Words and Images, Engendered by Rising Consciousness" which you can
read [on the Internet
Archive](https://archive.org/details/MetamagicalThemas/page/n143). Relevant
to this discussion:

I remember being quite struck by the argument at the time and agreeing
that they/them/etc. is not a viable solution to the problem of
gender-neutral pronouns. And yet today I struggle to find a problem
with "the writer will paint themselves into a corner". For some
reason, I now can immediately parse "themselves" as referring to a
single (imaginary) instance of the broader class of "writers". What
changed?

Well, I started using "they" and "them" in my own writing. For
instance, when I announce the winners of an election, I include the
sentence:

> They'll be joining the existing crew shortly&mdash;please thank them
> for volunteering, and share your assistance and advice with them as
> they learn the ropes!

For elections with two or more winners, that's obviously correct and
clear. (Well, sometimes I include that sentence even when the new
moderator already knows the ropes since they are a moderator on other
sites or have previously been a moderator on the current site.) But
when there's just one moderator, it's often tricky to pick a
gender. More than once, I've seen people guess (by editing my post)
and been exactly wrong. I decided not to worry about it too much;
being too generic is better than being specific and wrong.

In the modern world (at least in [the
West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world)) people
increasingly have the freedom to define their own
identities. Certainly this is true on the internet where [nobody know
you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)
unless you reveal yourself. That makes it possible for me to
[impersonate a
woman](https://jericson.github.io/2018/03/23/race_to_1k_6.html) if I
chose. Since we aren't collecting government IDs, we aren't in a
position to know or really care what gender people really
are.[^1] That includes people who do not wish to be either
"he" or "she" online. For those folks, it's imperative that we come to
some sort of agreement on a gender neutral pronoun if we are to be
accurate and avoid the slippery slope of sexism:

It seems to me that we regularly encounter this sort of ambiguity on
the network. How do we refer to a user represented by the image of
woman and the name of a man? One could check their profile and see if
they specify a gender. Using that gender is certainly the polite thing
to do.[^2] But failing that (because the profile doesn't
help), it's far safer to not assume gender. That can be awkward and
ambiguous, of course, but the fault lies in our language failing to
keep pace with cultural changes.

It's been pointed out to me (in the comments and out-of-band) that I
didn't _exactly_ answer the question. That's quite deliberate. The
question was clearly motivated by _a particular incident on the TL_,
but it's worded so as to be applicable to all sorts of situations on
the network. Therefore, I worded my answer to propose a principle that
can be applied to a variety of specific situations. So let's apply it
to the TL conversation.

But first, a pair of personal anecdotes. I have 6-year-old twins: a
boy and a girl. Like many 6-year-olds, they speak their minds and have
no filter. Unlike some children their age, they are also extremely
outgoing and eager to talk with anyone and everyone they meet. We have
a neighbor who has a son a few years older than them and she looks
much older than my wife. One day, the twins saw her after school and
got all excited about how his "grandma" was there to pick him up. I
don't know if she heard, but I very quietly told them she was probably
his mom. The next time they saw her, one of my twins started talking
about the boy's "mom or grandma".

They also have a cousin with long and rather beautiful hair. We see
them once a year or so. The last time we were together, my twins
started talking about how they wanted to see "that girl" again. We
were terribly confused until we figured out they meant my nephew with
the long hair, who is, of course, a boy. (Perhaps because they are
different sexes, my twins are very interested in gender differences.)
We're working on helping them remember that their cousin is a boy
because we want them to be able to have a good relationship with the
family.

My point is that we often draw wrong conclusions from various
observations we make about others. The effort we go to correct those
mistakes often depends on **the relationship we want to have** with
the other person. When it comes to strangers, I mostly want to teach
my children to keep unflattering observations to themselves. But when
it comes to family, I want to help them know (_conocer_ in Spanish)
their cousin.

Very nearly every interaction we have on the network is of the
"neighbor's mom" variety. The main thing is to avoid mistakes that
might hurt the other person's feelings. (On Stack Overflow, don't say
"you have no business writing code", for instance.) But chat rooms,
and the TL in particular, can feel a lot more like family. Y'all are
some of the most interesting and compassionate people I've ever met
and it makes sense that you'd want to form relationships. So it's not
surprising you'd expect people to respect very personal requests like
using a particular pronoun. It's a very reasonable expectation.

Now we've arrived at the reason I'm reluctant to answer the question
directly: I think it's ok for moderators to not be interested in
getting to know each other. It's been clear as long as I've had access
to the TL that it's just too big for that. (Arguably, the shift
happened around the time we passed [Dunbar's
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) of
moderators.) Most people in the TL are, to me, an avatar, a user name
and (maybe) a site where they moderate. I've interacted with a few
people over the years who I consider friends or acquaintances, so I
know them a lot better. That's a wonder side-benefit, but the prime
directive of the TL is to give moderators a space to help each other
with moderation issues.

When one person shares personal details with another, it opens up a
path for the other to betray that trust. For instance, I worry that
some readers are judging my parenting because I shared stories about
my children. Even in a private space (_especially in a private space_)
I'm vulnerable to how you will respond. For many people, their
prefered pronoun is a deeply personal matter and when others
deliberately use another pronoun that's a betrayal of trust. That some
moderators feel that way and even feel alienated from the room is
tragic.

I wonder if the problem is similar to what we sometimes see on [other
chat rooms](https://islam.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1472/138): repeated
controversial topics tend to be wearing. Why are we opening ourselves
up to pain by discussing these topics? If it's to help each other be
more effective moderators, that's wonderful and I'd love to help you
all have those conversations. But I fear that these conversations keep
coming up because everyone feels the need to have a say. And maybe we
just shouldn't be having these conversations that are tangential to
the purpose of the room.

[^1]: In our culture, which increasingly allows and encourages
    self-identification, even this sentence is presumptuous. It's not
    my job to tell people who they are _really_.

[^2]: One complication is that I don't really care for [Ze/Zir and
   Ze/Hir](https://www.mypronouns.org/ze-hir/). It's _my writing_ and
   I don't want to use those neologisms. So what do I do? Either suck
   it up and use the pronoun the user prefers or just avoid using
   pronouns. I do the later in the physical realm when it comes to
   infants. "What a lovely baby you have! What's the baby's name?"
   Would it be nicer to use pronoun? Sure, but nobody says you can't
   just use the actual noun.
