In the [previous episode](/2017/07/26/race_to_1k_1.html), I introduced
[Kathryn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7948068/kathryn), my
sockpuppet.[^1] In order to ask questions on Stack Overflow (and earn
reputation) I needed an account. I remember a few roadblocks when I
did it
[nearly 9 years ago](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/13/yearling?userid=1438),
but it wouldn't be too surprising if things changed in the meantime.

Since part of my goal in the race was to try out the Documentation
reputation system, figured I'd start by editing a topic. Unlike
Wikipedia (or
[Q&A posts, for that matter](https://stackoverflow.com/help/editing)),
we require users to be logged in to edit Documentation. So in place of
the option to submit a proposed change, I saw this:

![Documentation sidebar signup page.](/images/signup-2017-05-01.png)

The first thing to note is that there's no mention of OpenID. This is
kinda a big deal since OpenID was one of our
[key technology bets](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/04/13/openid-one-year-later/). When
I registered my first account, I used Blogger as my OpenID provider. I
still have that credential on the site, but I haven't used it since
early in 2012. Since then, I've used Google, Facebook, Yahoo and even
my [Stack Exchange OpenID](https://openid.stackexchange.com). We still
accept OpenID, but most of our users use credentials from a tiny
handful of sites. Not surprisingly, Google is a
[very large gorilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla)
that supplies almost all of our users' access. It's not exactly the
egalitarian, decentralized system we'd hoped for.

For the purposes of this test, I figured the path of least resistance
was to [create](https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup) an email and
password credential.[^2] But then I hit a little snag:

![What? Is my password no good to you?](/images/password-2017-05-01.png)

Complex password requirements have been the source of
[contention on meta](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/110678/can-stack-overflow-change-the-password-criteria),
so I won't go into too much detail about it. I will say I used
[1Password](https://1password.com/) to generate my password, so it
wasn't hard to generate a new one. However, I imagine a new user
would be more frustrated than I was.

Once I found a working password, I got a comforting message telling me
to verify my email:

![No, you may not see my sock's email address. But you may guess.](/images/confirm-2017-05-01.png)

This is a normal and expected step when linking an account on a
website to an email address, but it really takes you out of the flow
while you switch over to an email tab to find the message that looks
like:

![Found the email! The copy is a lie!](/images/email-2017-05-01.png)

Again, a typical transactional email. Unfortunately, I'm _not_ almost
done. Instead of taking me back to where I was before starting on this
quest, Stack Overflow dumped me into
[this page](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/create):

![Still a lie!](/images/share-more-2017-05-01.png)

Ok, this is still standard. The best time to get someone to fill in
their profile is right after it's created. Changing my avatar and
display name are two steps that make me look less like a throwaway
account and more like a real person. I can also see the value in
listing a few favorite technologies. We do use this to show you
[better results](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/09/stack-overflow-homepage-changes/)
when browsing questions. The soft pitch for Stack Overflow Jobs isn't
a bad idea here either.

But the "Where do you code?" question feels just a bit, um, prying?
Different people have different levels of tolerance for this sort of
thing. I tend to be really open online. (I very nearly left my
personal email in [this image](/images/confirm-2017-05-01.png), for
instance.) But thinking about it from the perspective of a new user
who just wants to help out without telling the world her life story,
I'm kinda freaked out. Maybe it's just because I was worried someone would
discover my sockpuppet's true identity?

Luckily, I read (and already knew) that "Info will NOT be displayed in
your public profile". But it's not clear _which_ "info" would not be
displayed. Certainly the avatar and display name _will_. I don't think
my favorite tags are, but the position and employer
[definitely are displayed](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1438/jon-ericson?tab=profile). So
the blurb must be referring to just whether the user is interested in
a new job. That's important in the off chance my boss finds my profile
and discovers I'm thinking about quitting. But maybe I don't want my
employer to be public knowledge either?

Still, there's a notice (in small print) that "All fields are
optional". So I just clicked "Create my account" and got back to what
I was here for. Or, rather, not just yet:
 
![Developer story _is_ the final step.](/images/story-2017-05-01.png)

I'm going to get a bit ranty here[^3], but I want to make clear first
that there are good reasons for Stack Overflow to push people to fill
in their
[Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/10/11/bye-bye-bullets-the-stack-overflow-developer-story-is-the-new-technical-resume/). I
spent 15 years working for my first employer and the second half of
that time wasn't particularly rewarding. There wasn't enough work to
keep me busy, but I had very specialized knowledge that my employer
wanted to retain. Every year I'd ask for more work in my annual review
and every year I'd get broken promises in return. From talking to
other developers, I don't think my experience is unusual.

Nobody wants to think about entering the job market. Odds are people
who are just now signing up for a Stack Overflow account are either
looking for a job or ought to be. So a little prompt to start selling
yourself is not a bad idea at all. It sure doesn't hurt that it helps
[Stack Overflow's business](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/15/how-we-make-money-at-stack-overflow-2016-edition/)
while at the same time finding new talent for employers _and_
encouraging programmers improve their careers. It's a win all around
in my book.

**But**, this form does a rotten job of selling the concept. You might
have already noticed that it asks all the same questions as the
previous form with minor variations. If you were uncomfortable
submitting the company you work for, I don't imagine you'll care to
provide the location where you live. Only this time "All fields are
required." (Unless you notice the "Dismiss" link in light gray just
under the **big, blue "Continue" button**.) And unlike the previous
form, this one defaults users to the passive candidate status without
any indication of who will see that.

As an insider, I know (or at least have a good guess) why this
happened. There are two separate databases we keep on users. One is
for the
[profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1438/jon-ericson?tab=profile)
other users see on the site and the other is for potential
employers. The second form starts users on the path toward building
[their CV](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/jericson). The name field is
asking for my legal name, location is used to help me find jobs close
to me and preferred technologies need not be tags on the site at
all.[^4] But none of this is made clear to a new user. It just feels
like we are leading people on without letting them get to the task at
they came for. 

Worse, there's no clear reason or benefit to filling in this
information. Instead of "We use your Developer Story to match you with
the right jobs." (whatever that means), maybe we should tell users
what benefit _they_ might get. With just a little work on their CV
now, they put themselves in a position to be contacted by potential
employers later. And not contingency recruiters who are often sketchy,
but actual, in-house recruiters who can make attractive offers. Not
only that, but when you are ready to start looking actively, you'll
have something to work with so you don't need to start from scratch.

And, I don't know, maybe apologize for how long this is taking and
save some time by copying information we've already gathered?

But whatever. Kathryn isn't interested and found the "Dismiss"
link. Fortunately, this was the end of the signup process. [Next
time](/2017/08/17/race_to_1k_4.html), I'll finally get started writing
Documentation.

Footnotes:

[^1]:

    Ok, that sounds sorta weird and vaguely sexist when I read it back
    to myself. I'm not entirely sure how to phrase it better,
    however. I'll talk more about the name I used later in the
    series. For the purpose of this post, let's just focus on the
    process of creating a new profile.

[^2]:

    Underneath the hood, that's implemented as creating an OpenID
    credential on
    [our own service](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/05/27/stack-exchange-is-an-openid-provider/). Google
    credentials are _also_ OpenID under the surface. So it isn't as if
    we don't use the technology, we just don't make a big fuss about
    it anymore.

[^3]:

    I promise.

[^4]:

    Don't ask me why we ask for the status twice, however.
