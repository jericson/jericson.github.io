[With over 100 sites on various and sundry
topics](http://stackexchange.com/sites#newest),
Stack Exchange has become something of a juggernaught: keeping this
many different communities healthy and well-supported can be a bit
overwhelming at times. We'd never be able to pull it off if there
weren't so many of you pitching in to help, and so I'm more than happy
to announce that we've managed to convert another [dedicated
volunteer](http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/148/moderator-pro-tem-announcement)
to full-time cat-wrangler:


## [Jon Ericson](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1438/jon-ericson)


![Jon and his family](/images/family.jpeg)

Jon became fascinated with computers when he got to play with his
cousin's Commodore 64 circa 1986. Over the years, Jon went on to write
many fine Hello World programs, and dabbled in one online community
after another: BBSes, AOL forums, Usenet, mailing lists, etc.


Jon has had an interesting relationship with Stack Exchange. Five
years ago, he read about the Stack Overflow beta and signed up. A year
and a half later, after asking and answering a respectable number of
questions, [Jon lost
interest](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/42481/the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivation). That
could have ended the story, but [when the network
expanded](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/changes-to-stack-exchange/)
to topics outside of technology Stack Exchange's not-so-secret sauce
of voting, editing, focused Q&A, and, yes, reputation [dragged him
back
in](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/42481/the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivation/141021#141021). Jon
got involved in a few more beta sites, and his renewed interest was
solidified by several amazing answers to his Bible questions.


Jon's always been active in supporting the development of the
communities he's a part of, debating policies and suggesting
improvements going all the way back to the User Voice days on Stack
Overflow. For a long time, Jon didn't see the point in closing
questions and deleting posts (indeed, he once wrote a (long!) answer
titled, "Closing Questions Considered Harmful") after all, it wasn't
like disk space was too expensive. But after years of getting great
answers from people who knew their stuff, the idea finally clicked: it
wasn't disk space, but the _time_ of great participants that is at a
premium. This sort of knowledge gained from experience has proved
instrumental in helping Jon to provide guidance to folks using Stack
Exchange for the first time.


Just about every minute Jon isn't online is a minute he spends with
family: his wife, ten-year-old son, and boy/girl twins born in
January. They enjoy camping, reading, playing games, travel, and
church.


Jon has repeatedly impressed us with his ability to analyze a
situation and produce thoughtful, well-reasoned advice – we're looking
forward to seeing him bring this skill to bear on the various
challenges facing the network.
