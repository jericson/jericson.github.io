Reviewing a game that was played for [over a thousand
years](http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/92/archaeological-finds) and
doesn't have a single defined rule set is tricky. Boards have been
been found carved into wood (often with [Nine Men's
Morris](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3886/nine-mens-morris) on
the reverse side) that have anywhere from 7x7 to 18x18 squares. The
game [described by Carl
Linnaeus](https://bonaludo.com/2019/02/06/tablut-and-linnaeus-contribution-to-the-world-of-games/)
uses a 9x9 board with 16 attackers and 8 defenders of the
king. However, if he'd discovered the game in a different location,
it's entirely possible he'd have recorded a different set of
rules. Tablut is just one entry in a family of games where defenders
must escort the king off the board in order to win and attackers work
to prevent this from happening.

A few years ago my wife gave me a leather board that can be cinched up
into a small bag for carrying around. I substituted some [sea
glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_glass) for the defenders that
came with the board. No idea if any Viking owned a set like mine, but
it's fun to imagine warriors reliving their exploits on such
equipment.

For reference, I've mostly played the rules from the [Board Game Arena
implementation](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=tablut). That
means:

1. The king must escape via a corner square, not the edge of the
   board.
2. The king is unarmed, meaning he can not participate in captures.
3. The king's starting square (throne) can be passed through, but not
   occupied by any piece except the king.

That there are variants stems, in part, from the oral nature of the
game. Until Linnaeus wrote them down in his methodical way, there was
no common set of rules except what people agreed upon. It's easy to
imagine an outsider coming to the table and needing a quick primer on
the local customs for the game. And, of course, it would be natural
for people to try the rules the newcomer brought as well. Perhaps some
were added just to break up standard openings and other habits.

More importantly, however, the variants tend to favor one or the other
side. It gives the defenders an advantage if the king can escape
anywhere on the edge of the board. When the king can capture, it means
the attackers must be more careful in their approach. The various
rules about whether or not the throne (or the attackers' camps) can be
re-entered or used as path tip the balance toward one side or the
other. One gets the sense that variants served to restore balance
between asymmetric forces. Or, perhaps, they acted as a handicap to
make contests between players of differing skills less one-sided.

Games go fairly quick. (One [online
service](http://aagenielsen.dk/hnefatafl_online.php) reports [an
average of 36 moves](http://aagenielsen.dk/tafl_spillaengder.php),
which seems about right in my experience.) As with all abstract games,
the time per move depends on the time each player dedicates to
thinking about their options. As with well-designed abstract games,
the decisions don't often come easy.

For instance, the attackers have such a large advantage in material it
seems wise to make even trades. But since defender pieces block the
king just as efficiently as attacker pieces, there's a cost to
clearing the board. More importantly, it's easy to get distracted by
capturing on one side of the board as the king slips away on the
other. Meanwhile, the defender must move the king to escape, but it
very much pays to wait for the right moment. Leaving the throne too
early is a good way to lose early.

This might be a good time to reveal I'm terrible at Tablut. This is
odd because I'm [an above average chess
player](https://jlericson.com/2021/01/03/chess-review.html). Only
maybe it isn't. As Moshe Callen
[writes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/344992/brandubh-or-starting-examine-tafl-games-play):

> Modern players are pre-conditioned by games like chess and draughts

He further compares one Tafl variant,
[Brandubh](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33692/brandubh), to
[Go](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188/go) for the attackers
since the goal is enclosure. Instead of the strict symmetry of Go and
Chess (with the sole exception of the starting player), Tablut gives
opponents differing resources to accomplish different goals. It's one
instance of a larger system of games that bears some resemblance to
other grid-based games (Chess and Go in particular), but must be
addressed on its own terms.
