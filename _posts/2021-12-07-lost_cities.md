If this were a review of the [Lost Cities iOS
app](https://videogamegeek.com/videogame/134994/lost-cities-2012-ios)
I'd describe the game in abstract terms:

> Lost Cities is played with a deck of 5 suits. Each suit includes
> cards numbered 2-10 plus three coin cards. Both players are dealt 8
> cards to make up their hand. The goal is to score the most points by
> playing cards into your personal tableau. Each suit goes in its own
> column and cards must be played in increasing value. So once you
> play the green 4, you can no longer play the green 2 or 3.
>
> Cards score at their face value, but as soon as you start a suit you
> lose 20 points. So if the first card you play is the 4, that column
> is at -16 (-20 + 4). Before you play any numbers in a column you may
> play a coin card to increase the value of that column for you. One
> coin doubles, two coins triple and three coins quadruple. Coins also
> increase the cost of the column, so starting with 3 coins means that
> column costs 80 before the first number is played. Each number,
> however, is also multiplied when scored.
> 
> Instead of playing a card, you may discard a card into one of the 5
> shared discard piles (one per suit). After you play or discard, you
> must draw the top card from either a discard pile or the deck. As
> soon as the deck runs out the game is over. In addition to scoring
> for the face value of each card, you score 20 points for laying 8 or
> more cards in a column. Coin cards count for getting to 8, but don't
> increase this bonus.

You get the idea. Due to limitations of screen size the app doesn't
display illustrations on the cards and simplifies the iconography to
numbers, coins and colors. "Lost Cities" could easily be a name like
[Gin Rummy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25574/gin-rummy) or
[Klondike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)) that's
evocative without really relating to the game itself.

This, however, is a review of the physical game with fanciful
illustrations of lost cities that you aim to explore. In particular,
the [2019 edition that includes a 6<sup>th</sup>
expedition](https://store.thamesandkosmos.com/products/lost-cities-card-game-with-6th-expedition):

These cards suggest a very different way of explaining the rules. It's
not "suits" but _expeditions_! We must play higher cards because we
can't afford to backtrack in our quest to discover the lost city. The
multiplier cards aren't boring coins but rather handshakes that
increase our commitment to that one expedition. Discarding cards means
the other player may acquire the clues we've gathered, so beware of
that. And, of course, expeditions require spending resources that
might not be recouped by discoveries.

Holding the extra large cards with beautiful images showing exotic
locations feels extravagant. Ordinary playing cards (4 suits using
aces to mark the discard piles and face cards as handshakes) would
work nearly as well from a mechanical perspective. But that will never
result in drawing a giant head buried in drifting snow or a jungle
waterfall or a city surrounded by volcanic lava. The illustrations add
weight to the decision to play or hold or discard each card.

Now to be fair, it's also the case that you'll learn to focus on the
number and suit on the top of each card while taking no notice of the
art.  Most of the experience of playing Lost Cities is in the realm of
the abstract with the theme fading into the background. So the cards
serve the purpose of attracting new players, justifying a few of the
rules and sparking the imagination when players _do_ notice the
illustrations.

Of course this is true of all games. When you first play
[Wingspan](/2019/12/29/review-wingspan.html), there is a delight in
discovering how each card has a gameplay purpose thematically tied to
the species it depicts. Peregrine falcons hunt birds with small
wingspans. But after playing a bit, the peregrine falcon card becomes
a mechanism for (potentially) tucking another card for points. Even
strong themes lose their power when the goals and actions of the game
take center stage.

Some reviewers talk about how the theme of Lost Cities is "pasted
on". I suspect they mean that it could have been replaced with any
number of other themes. Perhaps. But it's also a theme that's purely
additive and fits the mechanics nearly perfectly. Neither the
mechanisms nor the theme has been compromised in the process.

Not to pick on Wingspan, which is generally considered to have an
excellent theme, but it doesn't hold up if you overthink it. Requiring
the sacrifice of an egg or two before playing bird cards seems
thematic until you notice the egg used to play a hummingbird comes
from a mallard nest. Lost Cities doesn't simulate archaeology any more
than Wingspan simulates avian ecology, but both produce sensations
appropriate to their themes.

The 2019 edition adds a purple expedition to what appears to be an
extraterrestrial megalith city. It's mostly a way to add length to the
game, from what I can tell. It adds variety even if you simply
substitute it for another color and keep the number of expeditions at
five. (Or drop down to four to speed up the game even more.) All the
art has been updated and it's possible to lay out each expedition to
see what the original painted panoramic looked like.

The new art changes the wager card from what looks like a bet between
rivals at the explorers club to a simple handshake. It suggests an
agreement between the expedition and a local guide, which works just
as well thematically. Hiring a guide or three would, of course, raise
the expense of an expedition while increasing the value of your
discoveries. I appreciate that each expedition has a different sleeve
illustration that fits with its locale. What doesn't change, oddly, is
that the handshakes are always between a large white and a slender
black hand. More variety would be nice.

Lost Cities feels simple because it doesn't have a lot of rules. Just
pick one of 8 cards in your hand to play/discard and pick up a new
card from a discard pile or the deck. Playing a turn comes easy when
there are cards that can be safely played (once you play a 2, it
doesn't hurt to play the 3 in that color) or discarded (if both
players have played a number in a column, the handshake cards are
worthless). This is the multiplayer solitaire situation.

At other times the decisions come hard. Starting a game with high
cards can be something of a curse because you give up the opportunity
to play any lower cards if you play them and they clog up your hand if
you don't. Playing a high card early also lets your opponent discard
lower cards in that expedition freely. The eight slots in your hand
are your most precious resource.

Meanwhile, playing low cards early can pay off even if you don't have
the high cards to support them. You'll draw roughly half the deck and
there's a good chance you'll be able to play more valuable cards
later. In fact it can be a good gamble to play an uncovered handshake
card despite the risk you won't reach 20 to break even. If nothing
else, it immediately frees up a slot in your hand.

Maybe you're better off discarding uncovered handshakes since it puts
the decision about what to do with it on your opponent. But this is
also a gamble because they might have some high cards ready to play on
that expedition. Toward the end of the game, discarding handshakes
might tempt the other player to pick them up even though time runs
short to take advantage.

Ending the game has strategic implications too. Obviously you don't
want to miss out on scoring cards from your hand when the game ends,
so you might chose to draw from a discard pile rather than hurrying
the end game by using the draw pile. But if you are in the lead,
ending the game sooner is usually the right move. These are by no
means easy decisions.

Scoring at the end of a round is, unfortunately, a bit of a
chore. It's not hard and you shouldn't need paper to do the math. If
you prefer, there are sites that do the math for you, such as [the one
I maintain](https://lost-cities.netlify.app/). Waiting for the totals
can be a dramatic moment, I suppose, but it's always a bit of a
disappointing way to end a game.

I would now like to address valid and invalid criticisms of Lost Cities:

* "It's too simple."&mdash;This is invalid because it's simple in the same
  way espresso is simple. A few ingredients carefully assembled
  produce a rich and complex, if short, experience.  The valid form of
  criticism is "I prefer more intricate variations such as
  [Battleline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/760/battle-line) or
  [Keltis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34585/keltis)." Like
  espresso, the Lost Cities mechanics are the basis for other
  variations.
* "The theme doesn't matter."&mdash;Not entirely valid for the same reason a
  fine espresso is best enjoyed in attractive demitasse. I mean, it
  still tastes the same to use a tiny paper cup, but it's not the
  ideal experience.
* "Luck plays a bigger role than skill."&mdash;Wrong. It is true that
  like all card games there is a random element. It's not a perfect
  information game like [Bosk](/2021/11/18/bosk.html) or
  [chess](/2021/01/03/chess-review.html). The skill in card games
  comes from managing risk rather than working out future moves. I
  will say it feel unfair to draw a number one lower than the what you
  just played. It's easy to remember that happening without also
  remembering the times that play worked out. (No espresso analogy for
  this point. Sorry!)
* "Too much math to figure out who is in the lead."&mdash;Before I
  visited Italy, I figured the right way to drink espresso was to
  sip. Italians consume espresso (or, as they call it, _caffè_) at the
  counter in a few quick gulps. Pay your barista and it's off to
  whatever you have planned to do next. Same with Lost Cities. Enjoy
  the experience and put off the calculations until the later. (Or
  learn to do the math in your head to gain an advantage!)
  
Lost Cities is the sort of game that manages to offer interesting
decisions while also being comfortably familiar. It comes quite close
to being a perfect experience for two players with the single (and
minor) flaw of requiring a few moments of scoring at the end to
determine the winner.
