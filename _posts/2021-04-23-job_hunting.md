Last month I was laid off. It was strictly a money thing and several
other people were let go at the same time. The good news is I feel
pretty good about the progress I made helping [revive College
Confidential](/2021/03/18/leaving_cc.html). There's more to do,
obviously, but I laid a good foundation that should make it easier for
my replacement.

This is an account of my job search. I believe [my experience is
unique](/2020/07/08/reader_mail.html) and I've been blessed with a
particularly easy transition. I have accepted a new position which I
will discuss in the future. For now, I'm just writing about the
process of finding work as a community manager.

## Applying for unemployment

The day I learned I was losing my job, I started [an Unemployment
Insurance (UI) claim](https://edd.ca.gov/unemployment/). Halfway through
online form, I entered my termination date and discovered you can't
start the process until your last day. So I saved my application. For
reasons I don't understand, the system discards unfinished
applications on Saturday, which was awkward since I started mine on
Friday.

Because the states are managing [Pandemic Unemployment Assistance
(PUA)](https://www.dol.gov/coronavirus/unemployment-insurance), there
is more pressure on the system than normal. Whenever I call the phone
number to get help with my claim, the recording emphasizes the
Employment Development Department (EDD) has brought on more resources
to handle the increase in claims. That may be so, but often my call is
dropped just after I navigate their menu. And you can't skip the
announcements, so it takes several minutes to get to that point.

The reason I needed to call was because you need an EDD number to log
into the UI website. How do you get an EDD number? In theory, it comes
in the mail after you make a claim. I didn't get that, but I did get a
letter titled "REQUEST FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION". The letter didn't
include my EDD number, but it did list a Social Security Number
(SSN)[^1] that started with 990. That's not my SSN.

When I called the number for verifying my identity[^2] I was able to
get through to a human who explained the SSN wasn't really an
SSN. Turns out EDD suspected my claim to be fraudulent[^3] so they
suspended my real SSN and issued me a new one. The guy I talked to
figured it out because these fake SSNs always start with 99. He spent
a few minutes checking to be sure I'd already verified my identity
online[^4]

Then he told me I just needed to check the website for more
updates. Before he hung up, I asked if I could get my EDD number so I
wouldn't need to keep calling. Thankfully he was able to help me out
with that. Now I can see my status:

![Somehow my weekly benefit amount is
$0.00.](/images/ui_claim_status.png)

That's underwhelming. But now that I'm logged in, I can send a
question electronically![^5] Here's the automated response:

> Date: 04/14/2021
> 
> **To:** JONATHAN   L   ERICSON
> 
> **Question Topic:** Filed a Claim, No Response  
> **Question:** I started a claim on March 12, but I abandoned it when

> date. March 19 was my last day on the job, so I filed a claim that

Fortunately, I don't need the money right now. My wife is working full
time and I'll be back to work soon. If I needed the cash to pay bills,
I suppose I'd keep calling until I got through to someone. It's
dehumanizing though. Basically the system seems designed to prevent
people from using it.

## Getting leads 

Meanwhile, I decided to find a job. The obvious start is [my LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonericson/). I get the
occasional message already from recruiters asking whether I'm
interested in a community manager job. So I set my status to say I was
open to a new job with a title and salary. I also set up a job search
to email me new community manager jobs. These seemed to come in three
varieties:

1. Really more like a social media manager position.
2. Community manager for a brand's presence on Reddit. Seriously.
3. Property manager for home owner's associations (HOA). There's even
   [a certification for that job](https://www.camicb.org/about-camicb).
   
Then I noticed my search was limited to the LA area. There were also a
few community manager positions for digital games and technology
companies in the area. When I changed the location to the US and
picked the filter for remote jobs, I got [much better
results](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_WRA=true&keywords=community%20manager&location=United%20States). If
nothing else, it eliminated the HOA jobs.

I also used [Stack Overflow
Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/remote-developer-jobs). Again, I
updated my status to be actively searching and looked as the
listings. Since I'm not a programmer anymore, I suppose I shouldn't
have expected anyone to message me about a job. So I was not
disappointed. 

Due to the pandemic, more companies are discovering the value of
online communities. So there's something of a gold rush to help
companies build and manage communities. One of the better resources is
the Community Club, which has [a job
board](https://www.community.club/jobs). Even better is their
[chat](https://www.community.club/chat) which includes a "jobs"
channel where people give an elevator pitch for community manager
positions. It's really handy to be able to ask questions about the
listings.

I didn't use it myself, but CMX has [a job
board](https://cmxhub.com/jobs/) too. They also have a space for chat,
[host conferences](https://events.cmxhub.com/), [offer
training](https://cmxhub.com/academy/) and even [publish a survey for
CMs](/2021/03/23/2021_CMX_report.html). [FeverBee](https://ondemand.feverbee.com/)
is another company aimed at training community managers. They have a
thread on their forum for posting jobs, but it's not hugely active.

The trouble with job listings is they kinda all run together. And I'm
sure from an employer's perspective résumés have the same
problem. Everything looks great when you cherry pick your best
attributes. Everything also looks the same. So I'm left with
irrational filters such as:

* Oh! I've heard of this company.
* Ugh. They list MySQL experience as a requirement. No thanks.
* "We work hard and play hard."
  [Hmmmmm...](https://medium.com/@simplerants/what-does-work-hard-play-hard-really-mean-c90f498fd70f)
* What does it mean that the seniority level is "Associate"? I bet
  they don't pay well.
  
As you can see, I'm looking for ways to exclude jobs more than include
them. At this stage in my career, I know what I'm good at and where I
might struggle. As my pastor explained years ago, we go through stages
in life:

1. The ["Yes"
   years](https://www.ted.com/talks/shonda_rhimes_my_year_of_saying_yes_to_everything)
   when we need to say yes to things even if they don't seem like a
   good fit.
2. The "No" years when we need to start focusing in on what we _are_ good at.
3. The years of mastery when we pass on what we've learned though
   experience to the next generation.
   
So when [Aarthi](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/aarthi-devanathan/)
asked if I was interested in a career change to become a community
manager, I said "yes" (eventually). I still need to say "yes"
sometimes to things I want to say "no" to, but more and more I'm
focusing in on my God-given talent for building healthy
community. When I look at job listings, I'm watching for the rare
position that will bring me closer to mastery.

## _Really_ getting leads

Truth is, I didn't get where I am by browsing job listings. No, I owe
my career to friends and family who guided me to opportunities I
wouldn't have found on my own. An internship my dad told me about led
to a programmer job at JPL which led to a community manager job at
Stack Overflow. A close friend from college helped me discover a role
at College Confidential. And the moment I announced I'm a free agent,
I got an overwhelming number of leads from people I've worked with
over the years. If you were one of them, I can't tell you how much
that means to me. Thank you.

People talk about their network, but that's not the way I think about
it. I mean, it's _a_ way to think about the collection of people who
care about you and your success. Since [communities are
fractal](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/393552/an-account-of-my-meeting-with-the-stack-overflow-management-team/393553#393553),
I don't have a problem calling the many people in my corner "my
community". If you have one, it makes all the difference.

## Résumés and curriculum vitae

Résumés[^6] are how job seekers pay back recruiters for job
listings. You gotta assume they have hundreds of résumés for each job
they want to fill and their #1 goal is to cut that down to a handful
of people they will have time to contact for the initial screening
interview. That means you should tailor your résumé for the jobs you
are applying to. For instance, if the listing asks for a certain type
of experience, make sure you list whatever comes closest to that
requirement. This is one of the easiest ways to filter out résumés.[^7]

When I wrote my first résumé,[^8] I struggled to fill
out a single page. I had to list my lawn mowing and babysitting jobs
along with my high school graduation date. At this point I have tons
of experience and most of it is irrelevant to whatever job I'm
applying for. In fact I wrote two résumés this time: one that
emphasized my community management skills and the other that brought
out my technical experience.

It helped that every now and then I add accomplishments to [my CV on
Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/jericson). That way I
could just copy stuff I'd already written (and likely would have
forgotten) years ago and edit for whatever job I'm aiming
for. Community managers take on all sorts of tasks, so you never know
when something you've done will be relevant.

Finally, be sure to share your résumé with friends and family before
sending it out. I had fantastic input from many people who helped me
sell myself. Whether it's false modesty or a blind spot to your own
abilities, this tends to be difficult without some external
perspective. Once again, a big thanks to everyone who helped me.

## Interviewing

Recruiters tend to prefer audio phone calls, in my experience. You can
learn a lot about a company's attitude to toward remote work by
whether other interviews are conducted on a video call or not. It
doesn't even matter if the video is on. One person I interviewed with
turned off his camera because he was walking his dog. That's a good
sign for a healthy remote culture.

Interviews ought to be comfortable conversations. When I've been on
the hiring side, I go out of my way to give the candidate a chance to
get comfortable. Small talk and softball questions to start. When I'm
being interviewed, I can get a pretty good idea of how it went by
whether the conversation felt natural and interactive. Answering
questions correctly isn't nearly as important for community management
since there aren't exactly clear answers.

**Next time**: My new job as a developer advocate.

Footnotes:

[^1]: Amusingly it's labled `SSN No.` which I assume was a redundant
    use of "number". Kinda like "ATM machine".

[^2]: It's (866) 401-2849, if you are curious.

[^3]: I didn't ask why, but I assume it's related to the claim I
    started the week before my termination date. 
    
[^4]: The state uses [ID.me](https://www.id.me/) so I already had an
    account from renewing my driver's license in November. This time
    it needed to scan my face, which is a bit unsettling.

[^5]: The contact form helpfully notes:

   >  If you have a question about your UI claim, you can contact the
   >  EDD online, by mail, or by phone. The fastest way to contact the
   >  EDD is by submitting a question below. Some topics are
   >  informational only while other topics will allow you to submit a
   >  question and receive a response. You may submit two questions
   >  per day.
   
   The "fastest way to contact the EDD" takes "5-7 days" as it turns
   out.

[^6]: Or should I say "Resumes"? Can't decide if the accents
    communicate "playful" or "pretentious"?
    
[^7]: Even easier: automated résumé scan software. This is another
    reason applying via a job listing isn't ideal. Much better to skip
    this step by getting a direct referral.

[^8]: I used WordPerfect for that résumé. Later I switched to [Plain
    Old Documentation](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod) which I
    converted to LaTeX using
    [Pod::LaTeX](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::LaTeX) so that I could
    make a PDF. This time, I wrote [my résumé in
    Markdown](https://github.com/jericson/jericson.github.io/blob/master/resume.md). Converting
    to PDF isn't hard with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). With all of
    these I focus on content rather then get bogged down with
    formatting.
