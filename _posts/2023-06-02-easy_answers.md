In [my professional life](https://jlericson.com/resume/), the phrase
"low-hanging fruit" has been repeated so often it has developed a
meaning outside of the metaphor it came from: "Why not do this easy
thing now so that we can have progress while we're waiting for the
harder things to get done?"

We have a few fruit trees, including my prized kumquat that I moved
from the backyard to the front [when we started a construction
project](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/construction-begins/158):

I'm tall enough to reach all of the fruit on this particular tree, but
suppose I were shorter or this tree were taller. I'd need to invest in
some way to get all the fruit:

* Deploy my ladder.
* Fashion a fruit harvester with a long pole, a hook and a basket.
* Employ an expert who knows the tricks to harvesting this fruit.

In the meantime, I can just grab the fruit that's easiest to reach:

![Fallen fruit](/images/fallen_fruit.png)

That might work for today, but what about tomorrow? I still need to
show progress and there are no more low-hanging fruit on the
tree. Thankfully, there are a few fruit that have fallen. These are
even easier to collect and maybe nobody will notice they are shriveled
and rotten? If they do, I'll just collect twice as much fruit off the
ground and say quantity makes up for low quality.

This is the inescapable logic of low-hanging fruit. Getting the "easy
wins" means you aren't working toward the real wins. It means making
the numbers today and hoping something will bale you out
tomorrow. It's a recipe for poor results.


_The Wire_ demonstrates the "low-hanging fruit" problem in the context
of the city of Baltimore. Across the 5 seasons of the show cops can
either make the numbers or do real police work. It's easier to turn a
felony into a misdemeanor (thus "reducing" crime) than actually solve
crimes, so guess what most of the cops do? Similarly, schools
sacrifice effective education in order to increase test
scores. Politicians put off painful, but necessary, policies in order
to win reelection. Newspapers stretch the truth in order to pursue
Pulitzer nominations. Nobody is immune from short-sighted gaming of
the metrics.

David Simon's entire talk is worth watching, by the way:

The problem is bigger then [Goodhart's
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)[^1],
however. Frequently "low-hanging fruit" comes with the implicit
assumption that making progress in one small part of a problem means
progress is being made in the entire problem. That's hardly ever true
and especially not true in the analogy. Picking low-hanging fruit
doesn't make the high-hanging fruit any easier to harvest!

If you want to harvest all the fruit, you can go after the low-hanging
fruit _if it's helping you learn how to reach your goal_. Go ahead and
pick fruit from the lower branches as you test the stability of your
ladder. It's just there's a huge risk you'll be distracted from your
goal.  _Or you might fall into a much worse trap_.

And now we can finally discuss the quote at the top of this post. I'm
going to pick on Bernie Sanders to illustrate the point. He was once
asked by a student from Russia [how socialism in the US could avoid
the atrocities of the Soviet
Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yykVYR43TQ&t=276s). He used
the example of a neighbor to Russia, Finland, which has a democratic
socialist government. Later he listed a few more examples:

> I'm talking about Finland. I'm talking about Denmark. I'm talking
about Sweden.  I'm talking about countries all over the world.

Only these aren't countries all over the world. They are all part of a
tiny corner of the world called Scandinavia. By population, Finland,
Denmark and Sweden are roughly the same size as Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Michigan. They are 60-75% Lutheran, which is one sign they are
substantially more homogeneous culturally than the US. I'd say these
countries are low-hanging fruit when it comes to trying out democratic
socialism.

It's hard to argue that democratic socialism doesn't work because we
can see it working in Scandinavia. I wouldn't be surprised if it could
work in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan too. It's much harder to
imagine it working in larger, more diverse states such as Texas,
California or Florida. Not to say it _can't_ work outside of
Scandinavia, but rather success in the easy case doesn't demonstrate
progress toward solving the harder case. And this goes for free
markets or libertarianism or any other "answer in a paragraph" you
could name.

Solutions to hard problems frequently require solutions that look
nothing like the solutions to easy problems. In grade school I was
taught the [sieve of
Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to
find the prime numbers less than 100. But [large primes require other
techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_primes#Large_primes). If
you insist on using the simple technique, you will never discover more
advanced methods.

Maybe it'll help to look at a time when _I_ made this mistake. Stack
Exchange (and especially Stack Overflow) has the reputation of being
harsh with new users. A lot of people, especially people in the
company, figure the solution is, you know, [telling people to be a bit
nicer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311874/why-is-se-giving-so-much-attention-to-the-be-nice-policy). Now
that idea's naive and simplistic. (Has anyone ever responded well to
being told they are too mean?) So I came up with another solution: Why
not educate new users about the culture of the network so that they
understand why established users are behaving they way they do?

In theory this is a lot better than scolding people to be nicer. There
was a lot to do. We could [edit the language of existing
documentation](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/279879/improved-help-center-site-specific-pages-and-site-specific-edits-to-all-pages/281485#281485)
and [add new
documentation](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/165006/what-are-these-notices-above-my-post/172592#172592). We
could [fix the
UI](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/357951/what-can-we-put-in-a-question-template-to-help-people-ask-better-questions). We
could [encourage established user to participate in the education of
new
users](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355950/is-idownvotedbecau-se-recommended/356051#356051). We
could [change the incentive
system](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/06/18/adios-to-unfriendly-badges-ahoy-lifejacket-and-lifeboat/)
to encourage editing questions.

If you look at these initiatives, they frequently make a small
difference in a limited scope.
