In other words, it's like threatening my kids with sending them to the
salt mines. It would be horrible if anyone took the threat as anything
other than a joke. So this was a game of telephone and it doesn't
appear anyone has successfully used a "shame badge" after all. That's
relief because if there were such a community it would [be an
unpleasant
place](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/12/16/badges-positive-only/).

The discussion got me to thinking about the role of shame in a
community. Evan sees the problem with a "shame badge" is the "shame"
part. He [responded to Nicol's

> I did you wrong calling it the shame badge!

But the way the joke is described, it kinda does seem like at least
the start of shaming people. It's a joke, so people can laugh it
off. It's also a joke with an edge to it. 

[!["Didn't wash hands" buzzer from The Far
Side.](/images/far-side-didn-t-wash-hands.jpeg)](https://store.gocomics.com/product/the-far-side-comic-art-print-didnt-wash-hands/)

My problem is that a shame _badge_ turns teasing into [institutional
shaming](/2017/03/31/suspension.html). Shame is a natural defense
against people attempting to subvert the purpose of the community. It
draws a line between people who are part of the community and those
who are not. It's an ancient, perhaps the most ancient, method of
community building. Shame is still incredibly effective, and
[potentially quite dangerous](/2023/11/18/standing_up.html), since it
works by dividing people into part of the group and excluded from the
group.

If shaming someone for not washing their hands takes the form of a
giant flashing sign, you best be sure you don't have any false
positives. I wouldn't trust any _automated_ system. Even a very simple
system like **suspended X times** can fail. For instance, a malicious
moderator (these are rare, but not extinct) might give a user X
suspensions in succession to give out the badge of shame, thus
violating the spirit of the thing.

Or maybe someone gets suspended a few times early on, matures into a
respected member of the community and asks for their account to be
suspended during finals week so they won't be tempted to log in while
they should be studying. Should that user get a badge of shame?
Eventually someone will find the edge cases in the system and get
unfairly auto-shamed.  Why risk causing lasting damage of shaming
someone who didn't deserve it?

What about a _manual_ shame badge? I'd answer that question with a
question: What does a badge accomplish that that suspension does not?
Suspending usually comes with some indication that the user did
something wrong while simultaneously removing the user from the
drama. If the user doesn't change their ways when they come back from
the suspension, suspend again. Ideally increase the length of the
suspension. No need for a separate shame badge.

In my estimation, a tiny percentage of people cause the majority of
community strife. Rooting out those people (what I call [finding the
Jack](2023/10/07/find_the_jack.html)) solves so many problems that
there's not much need for a gimmick like a shame badge.

Shame works in social situations because it's really a feedback
loop. Maybe a personal example would help. Back in 2011, I was active
on a new site: [Biblical Hermeneutics&mdash;Stack
Exchange](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/). I visited a
related site, [Christianity&mdash;Stack
Exchange](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/), and mentioned in
comments that people might get better answers on Biblical
Hermeneutics. Someone [called me out on
that](https://christianity.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/772/cross-recruiting-between-christianity-se-and-biblical-hermeneutics-se)
and I felt properly shamed. We had a back-and-forth and I changed my
behavior. Eventually I became a respected member of both communities.

What I was doing didn't break any rules, so the natural instinct is to
create a new rule. Calling me out worked better though because we were
able to talk about the underlying problems. It didn't have to go that
way, of course. I might have simply left in shame or defiantly
increased my efforts. The trouble with making rules is that they
funnel people into behavior that might not actually be best for the
group. Shame can be more flexible. 

Of course, shame can [go too far too
quickly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You%27ve_Been_Publicly_Shamed). Inevitable
that happens because people skip the parts of the process that would
allow mutual understanding. In the rush to show their alliance, people
forget their enemies are human too. 

For what it's worth, Evan Hamilton handled the situation really
well. A lot of people, including me, pushed back on his initial
statement. Instead of withdrawing, he took the time to listen and
moderate his views. Then he posted his more nuanced and considered
opinion. A win all the way around.
