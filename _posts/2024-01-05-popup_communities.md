It's still early, but I'm working on a service that I think will
combine the best parts of mailing lists with the simplicity
Facebook/Slack/etc. Even better, I think I can offer this service at
no cost to smaller groups. If you'd like to help me test this idea,
please visit [Build
Civitas](https://beta.buildcivitas.com/t/what-is-build-civitas-beta/5),
which is in very early beta.


Over the last few years, I've rather made a habit of leaving
jobs. Whenever I do, I try to keep in touch by joining or creating an
alumni group. It's so easy to drift off into new jobs and forget until
years later the friends you made along the way. Having an alumni group
has also [helped me get new
jobs](/2021/04/30/developer_advocate.html), which is pleasant. 

It's surprisingly hard to find a platform for these sorts of groups,
however. A quick summary with pros and cons:

* **Facebook**&mdash;Since nearly everyone already has a Facebook
  account and since Facebook Groups are free, it's not hard to get
  started. Unfortunately the Facebook algorithm doesn't always show
  new activity to group members. Also, some people don't have or want
  a Facebook account.
* **Slack**&mdash;If you already use Slack, setting up a new (free)
  workspace seems ideal. Unfortunately the free version is somewhat
  limited (90-day history is brutal) and nobody is going to pay per
  user to upgrade an alumni Slack.
* **Discord**&mdash;Perfect for people who already use
  Discord. Everyone else will forget it exists after a couple of
  weeks.
* **LinkedIn**&mdash;You will join and connect with all your former
  co-workers. But you'll never form a real community since everyone is
  there to get a new job. Maybe there are great alumni networks on
  LinkedIn, but I haven't seen them.
* **Email**&mdash;The old ways can be the best ways. Everyone has an
  email address, checks it regularly and so email remains the best way
  to contact former co-workers. It's a lot like LinkedIn in terms of
  not being great for building a community, however. Email plus
  something else (regular Zoom meetups, for instance) has produced the
  best results in my experience.
* **Group text**&mdash;Similar to email except people change phone
  numbers and there's always that one guy with an Android who makes
  your texts green.
  
I'd love to try an alumni group on Discourse, which [would be
ideal](/2023/12/08/why_discourse.html) except it's [either
expensive](https://www.discourse.org/pricing) or [fairly
technical](/2021/04/06/oracle_discourse.html) or both. For all it's
great points, Discourse is pretty much a non-starter for alumni
groups.

Groups of former co-workers is just one variation of what I call
pop-up online communities. These frequently form around some physical
group organizing their activities online:

* PTA
* book discussion
* choir
* church 
* scouting
* family
* neighborhood 

Mailing lists and text chains usually work just fine, though there are
always challenges with adding and removing people as the group's
composition changes. Facebook, Slack and Discord do a better job of
managing members. Again, Discourse would be great too, if it were
easier for the average person to get a server running.

This week [I helped set up a mailing list on
Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/seeking-help-getting-email-notifications-to-work-when-a-new-topic-has-been-added-to-specific-categories/290098/4?u=jericson). If
you know the levers to pull, it's an easy task. But [knowing which
lever](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/03/06/tap/) takes more
experience than most people care to obtain.  It occurs to me that I've
been working with Discourse [for years](/tag/discourse) and setting up
a workable system for pop-up communities doesn't seem difficult for
me. In fact, I'm setting up mailing list for [my mom's
writing](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/about-the-biography-category/249)
using Discourse.
