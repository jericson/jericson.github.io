Probably the first thing adults notice when they arrive at Disneyland
is that it costs
[at least $25 to park](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/guest-services/parking/).
Obviously, Disney has a virtual monopoly on nearby parking. Knott's
Berry Farm, the other theme park in Orange County,
[starts at $20](https://www.knotts.com/explore/directions) for that
reason. The place where the NHL Ducks play, which is sadly no longer
called the "Pond of Anaheim",
[charges $20 too](https://www.hondacenter.com/plan-your-visit/parking-directions/). Angel
Stadium is a
[relative bargain at $10](https://www.mlb.com/angels/ballpark/transportation/parking). So
why can Disney afford to charge so much?

One way to answer that is to describe what you get for your $25:

* The cashier is polite, effecient and seems happy to be there.
* You get a ticket that can be used for reentry. Does anyone use this
  feature? I don't know, but it costs nothing.
* The ticket is also designed so you can circle your parking spot and
  find it later:

* As you pull into the parking structure, an employee directs you to a
  lane created by traffic cones. You'll follow that line right to your
  appointed parking spot. There's no stress worrying about whether
  you'll find a spot. The only concern you might have is whether your
  spot will be close to the escalator. (You can avoid that by paying
  extra for preferred parking.)
* The parking system is designed to funnel cars in _behind_ recently
  parked cars so that you can safely walk to the escalator without
  risking being run over.
* There are <strike>employees</strike> cast members everywhere:
  directing traffic, moving cones and providing security. Everyone
  seems happy.
* Also: trash cans everywhere, none of them are full and garbage on
  the ground has a half-life measured in minutes. I'm pretty sure cast
  members are told to pick up trash even if that's not their primary
  job.

That's just parking! The rest of your day has been engineered to be
even more delightful.

Now parking isn't perfect. We recently visited when an escalator broke
down so it was slow to get everyone to the tram area. Since the floors
are parked one at a time, one escalator is full while the rest are
unused. There aren't enough elevators to handle all the strollers and
wheelchairs that come through, so people have to stand in a long line
for what I call "the first ride of the day". The top floor is
uncovered and gets insanely hot.

A new parking structure, which is currently getting built, will, no
doubt, eliminate some of those problems. If there's not somebody doing
nothing but thinking about how to make parking at Disney theme parks
better, it's because there are several such somebodies. Sometime in
the last ten years Disney moved the bag check and metal detectors to
the parking structure instead of directly in front of the park. It's
such a minor change, but having experienced both locations, the change
is obviously an improvement. I hope whoever made that discovery got a
good raise.

In essence, Disney can charge an extra $5 because they are constantly
working to make the parking experience better. They take their
tagline, "The Happiest Place On Earth", rather seriously.

Walking around Disneyland feels like visiting a carefully constructed
utopia. Remarkably, everyone seems to be in on the illusion. Employees
take on the role of "cast members" in the Disneyland production. With
the expection of employees playing Disney characters, every cast
member wears the same white oval badge with their first name and
hometown. Even management,
[identifiable by business clothes](https://publicaffairs.disneyland.com/leadership/)
rather than themed costumes,
[goes out of their way](https://www.businessinsider.com/disneyland-manager-day-in-the-life-2018-8#most-evenings-hell-play-some-ping-pong-with-his-sons-15)
to make sure guests are having a good time.

It's not obvious why _visitors_ play their part. Part of it could be
that when you pay a lot of money to do something, you are really
predisposed to believe you are enjoying that thing. This is why
legendarily terrible movies like
[Howard the Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_worst#Howard_the_Duck_(1986))
still get a
[passing grade from the folks who saw it on opening night](https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/d2Fy). Nostalgia
also plays a part. Disney properties are so entwined with popular
culture that _something_ is bound to bring back childhood memories.

One of my childhood memories was planning out, with my brothers, a
route to get us to each of the "mountains" (Space Mountain, Big
Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and the Matterhorn) in the park. For
us, these thrill rides were the only attractions that really
mattered. My dad's nostalgia took him to classic rides like the Jungle
Cruise and the Teacups. It wasn't until my daughter got old enough to
care that I discovered a whole new world of meeting Disney princesses.

In a sense, Disney has carved out paths for different types of
visitors. Other than having to deal with traffic (because of the
parade you don't care about, say), people don't really need to think
about paths they aren't on. When I see huge families with matching
T-shirts proclaiming the purpose of their reunion, I'm slightly
baffled about why they are paying so much when they could just meet at
a park and have a giant BBQ. But there _must_ be some path for these
groups since they seem to be having a wonderful time. (Maybe they are
the folks who go on "It's a Small World"?)

Implicitly, these paths exclude certain types of people too. The
roller coasters aren't nearly as crazy as the ones at Knott's, so
hardcore thrill-seekers either don't come or come for some other
reason. Disney has been slow to introduce alcohol to their parks
(though it's now available at California Adventure and the new Star
Wars expansion), so that's another barrier for some people.

I don't think Disney decided to make tame rides and serve only soft
drinks because they wanted to limit their clientele. Instead, they
wanted to make Disneyland delightful for families and parents don't
like to have deal with children who are disappointed in not being able
to ride an exciting ride or taste an exotic drink. Now that they've
perfected the family experience, they can start building paths for
other visitors.

The original mission of Stack Overflow was pretty clearly stated by Joel
in
[the first podcast episode](https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W6):

> So, what we're trying to get here, we could say, a place where you
> can ask questions, technical questions since we're programmers, and
> get answers and then get those answers rated and try to have the
> signal rise to the top and the noise just disappear forever.

It was a mission to create something that didn't exist, but obviously
_should exist_. And now it does! We've even hit Joel's larger mission:

>  Our longer term goal, if weâ€™re successful, is that you're trying to
>  figure out how to do something in Python like how to merge two
>  arrays in Python and you go to Google and you type "merge two
>  arrays python" and submit that, and our goal is to be the number
>  one hit that comes up with a really good edited answer to that
>  question that some individual has contributed and maybe other
>  individuals have edited.

I hardly needed to do it, but just in case I was overconfident, I
opened an incognito window and asked Google
[`merge two arrays python`](https://www.google.com/search?q=merge+two+arrays+python)
and the top result is a bunch of pages on Stack Overflow, including
[How do I concatenate two lists in Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-do-i-concatenate-two-lists-in-python)
That question was asked in the fall of 2009 and it's got almost 2
million views and the accepted answer was updated this year. I'd argue
that Stack Overflow was able to nail that mission because it's clear
and actionable.

Stack Overflow struggles to be a place where people are delighted,
however. Yes, people searching for solutions are often delighted to
find answers. But they leave as soon as they can. (If we're lucky,
they vote up the answers that helped and the questions that helped
them find those answers.) Askers aren't delighted because there are so
many (seemingly) pointless rules. Answerers _certainly_ aren't
delighted by repetitive and (seemingly) lazy questions. Curators
aren't delighted because, well,
[our moderation tools are pretty poor](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/386324/the-stack-overflow-i-wish-to-build-and-participate-in-is-no-longer-supported).

We need to build (and repair) paths for people to have a good
experience. This is one of the reasons that the
[Ask Wizard](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/381671/the-ask-question-wizard-is-live)
holds promise. The early results, however, suggest at most an
incremental improvement. Questions asked via the wizard get a
marginally better reception, but it's still frustrating for just about
everyone. Fixing the asking experience likely will take more
aggressive measures.

One idea that has come up internally would work something like the
[Code Golf Sandbox](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2140/sandbox-for-proposed-challenges?answertab=active#tab-top). Indeed,
it has the same name: a question sandbox would be an area where an
asker could try out their question and potentially get help from
others before publishing it to the world. It's kinda similar to a test
environment: you don't need to worry about breaking the production
system each time you make a change. At this point, Stack Overflow is
probably the largest collection of useful questions and working
answers ever created. Just about everything added to it amounts to
subtraction by addition and so we
[block tons of potential questions](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/318174/why-are-there-so-many-bad-questions/358412#358412)
to avoid duplication or unanswerable posts.

With a sandbox, new contributions could be vetted before going out to
the community of answerers. Done right, people answering questions
would see far fewer uninteresting, unanswerable and duplicate
questions. Curators could focus on improving a pool of public content
that isn't growing quite so fast. And, of course, askers could be more
confident doing the sorts of things that are necessary to learn a new
skill. (Everyone I talk to agrees asking is a skill not everyone
possesses.) Who knows? They might even
[rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
their way into a solution.

Obviously it won't solve every problem and might make new ones. But
like the crowd control systems at Disneyland (I neglected to mention
the surprisingly simple and effective
[Fastpass service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastPass)), a
sandbox-type system could prevent parts of the overall system from
getting overwhelmed. In any case, it breaks apart one complication of
the current asking system in which question vetting and answering
happen simultaneously.

I don't know if we'll pursue this particular path. (I don't make that
sort of decision.) But I think focusing on a specific mission and
clearing out the barriers users face is the only way we'll improve the
Stack Overflow experience.
