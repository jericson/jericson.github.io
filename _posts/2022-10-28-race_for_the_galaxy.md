I have a theory that when it comes to ratings and reviews, some games
benefit from a first mover advantage. For instance,
[Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) was the
first deck-building game many people played. As a result, Dominion is
also the bar a deck-building game must clear in order to be considered
"good". There can only be one first time of discovering the pleasure
of deck building, so it's hard to stack up against the classic of the
genre. If you disagree, maybe you haven't played enough Dominion to
learn all of its tricks.

Race for the Galaxy enjoys that same advantage in the tableau builder
space. Not that the game is overrated. More that it's the authentic
masterwork of the genre that casts suspicion on copycats such as [Ares
Expedition](https://jlericson.com/2022/07/30/ares_expedition.html) and
[Wingspan](https://jlericson.com/2019/12/29/review-wingspan.html).

As of this writing, I've played Race over 50 times on [Board Game
Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=raceforthegalaxy) and
the [iOS
app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/race-for-the-galaxy/id1190675052). That's
probably not enough to fully understand the intricate strategies of
the system. It would have been hard to get in a fraction of that
number with a physical copy, however. The digital implementations ensure I'm
playing the rules correctly and eliminate the common complaint about
the game's symbology. If you have any question about what a card does,
you can select it and get a description of exactly what the symbols
mean. After a game or two, it's not really that confusing anyway.

Thematically, Race is a [4X game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) in
the vein of [Master of
Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion). Each turn you
may select from 5 difference phases:

1. Explore (Draw more cards)
2. Develop (Play a development card)
3. Settle (Play a world card)
4. Consume (Discard goods for cards or victory points)
5. Produce (Place goods on worlds that produce goods)

If one player picks an phase, everyone else gets to do that action
too. Picking a phase guarantees that phase will this turn and provides
a bonus unique to the phase. This is the principle form of player
interaction.

Playing a card into your tableau generally requires discarding cards
from your hand equal to its cost. Goods are represented by face-down
cards taken from the draw pile. So the cards are pulling at least
triple-duty. Paying for cards with cards presents the trickiest
decisions in the game. Inevitably you'll find yourself being forced to
either discard a card you wish to keep or passing up an action.

Fortunately, some cards give discounts or bonuses for playing specific
types of cards or taking specific actions. "Investment Credits", for
instance, reduces the cost of all developments by one card and "Public
Works" grants a card draw after playing a development. Even better,
some worlds can be conquered militarily without spending any cards at
all. Of course, you'll need to dedicate space in your tableau to
military cards which generally don't help with the goods economy.

There are three ways to earn victory points:

1. Most cards award victory points if they are in the player's tableau
   at the end of the game.
2. 6-cost developments award victory points for each card in the
   tableau that meets specific conditions.
3. Consuming goods awards victory point tokens.

The game ends when either all the victory point tokens have been taken
or at least one player has at least 12 cards in their tableau.

On the whole, Race for the Galaxy's cards feel thematic. "Space
Marines" boost your military by +2 and the "Alien Rosetta Stone World"
makes it easier to settle alien planets. Exploring turns up possible
worlds to settle and developments to invest in. Producing and
consuming goods requires planning ahead. 

It's handy that most of the game can be played simultaneously. Of
course, that means there's very little player interaction after the
phase selection and before the final turn. I find myself focusing on
my own game and forgetting that other people can end the game before
I'm are ready. Players will want to maximize their last turn or two
by converting cards and goods into victory points before it's too
late.

Perhaps this is where the digital games let me down. I don't see a
dwindling pile of victory points or a growing collection of cards in
front of other players. Playing with strangers turns phase
selection into almost a random card flip. Sure I can look a their
tableau and guess what they will do, but without knowing their
personality I'm missing the psychological dynamic of the choice.

Having played Ares Expedition and hearing that it basically ripped off
Tom Lehman's ideas, Race wasn't as easy to grok as I'd expected. For
instance, there are 7 phase selection cards for 5 possible
phases. Why? Well two of the phases have two options for the bonus. So
you can either Explore with 1-1 (drawing a total of 3 cards and
keeping 2) or 5-0 (draw a total of 6 and keep 1). In the Consume step,
you chose to either trade goods for cards or consume goods for
double victory points

The 5-0 bonus is a good choice only when you _really_ need a
particular type card and keeping one extra card won't make a
difference. Basically that's the end of the game. Meanwhile, trading
goods for cards helps in the early game when you have windfall goods
and need cards more than victory points. So the options are
welcome. What's odd is that there are separate cards for each
option. Ares Expedition has two possible bonuses for Construction and
just lists them both on the same card:

> Draw a card  
> OR  
> Play and additional blue or red card this phase

I suspect the reason Race has separate cards has something to do with
the advanced two player game in which each person plays two phase
cards which might be the same phase. Whatever the reason, it's just
another quirk to learn to live with. There's no material difference
between deciding which Explore option to use during planning or a
moment later when the phase happens. But it really does matter which
Consume bonus you plan for since you might have wildly different needs
by the fourth phase of a turn.

Race for the Galaxy can be unforgiving. There are duplicate cards in
the deck, but you can't play duplicates in your tableau. The app
helpfully grays out duplicates so you know you should discard
them. But BGA doesn't warn you until you try to play a duplicate.  At
that point you're stuck with a wasted action unless you are lucky
enough to have an alternate card to play. It's part of the puzzle of
the game to avoid this situation, I suppose.

While I complimented the thematic cards, I'm much less a fan of the
game's generic (and gray) sci-fi setting. The card art isn't bad, but
it doesn't contextualize what you are doing. It's not an empire you
are building, but just a tableau of cards. The starting worlds aren't
where you came from, but just a nudge to build an engine to gain
victory points.

Compare to, say, the [four factions of Star
Realms](https://www.starrealms.com/factions/) which provide a
narrative base for that game. You don't need to read backstory because
the design of each faction's ships and bases evoke what that faction
is all about. Additionally, cards make cameos in other cards including
across faction lines. Consequently, the universe of Star Realms has a
coherence that Race for the galaxy lacks.

This brings me to the "first mover" concept in the opening
paragraph. I've played Star Realm thousands of times (really) on
the app and it's one of my son's frequent requests in person. So it
should come as no surprise that I prefer the world-building of Realms
over Race. Indeed I'm reluctant to review Star Realms _because my many
plays bias my opinion_.  Maybe Race has a better setting since it
doesn't collapse the entire universe into four distinct
cultures. Isn't the over-reliance on the familiar why I've grown tired
of Star Wars?

Each time I play Race for the Galaxy, I become more forgiving of its
rough edges. I'm avoiding mistakes and starting to see more
possibilities to pursue. The 2-player game "for experienced players"
feels like a real test of strategic thinking now. It's an excellent
game. But it's an excellent game that I had to play dozens of times to
appreciate. Most of those plays left me slightly annoyed and confused
about what made so many people love this game so much.
