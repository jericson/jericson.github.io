Yesterday we got a report from one of the moderators of Stack Overflow
who met with the company's CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar. I've already
[written my initial
thoughts](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/393553/1438) and I stand by
those. But I've also had a chance to sleep on it and there are a few
things from the answers that trouble me. Typically time helps me take
a more charitable view of someone else's words, but not this time.

It's important to know that what I'm responding to is not Prashanth's
words, but rather a paraphrase writen by Aaron Hall. So it wouldn't
surprise me if the phrasing is not what the company representatives
intended to communicate. Still there has been plenty of time to
correct the record, so I will assume they are comfortable with the
current wording.

As I said in my answer some of the answers can be ambigious when it
comes to the word "community". Probably the easiest place to see the
duplicity of meaning is:

> Employees that put community first will be rewarded.

The obvious counter argument is that two Community Managers who have
consistently put community first were [let
go](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392867/in-case-you-missed-it-shog9-and-robert-cartaino-are-no-longer-staff-members-at). There
are only two ways to reconcile this:

1. The policy to reward employees who put community first is more
   recent than the termination of those two employees.
   
2. The company means something different by "community" than I do.

I find the first option very hard to believe since [the community has
raised
$10k](https://www.gofundme.com/f/thanking-josh-heyer-for-shaping-stack-overflow)
to thank Shog9 for his service and the company has not. Money isn't
everything, of course, but it is a reward companies commonly give to
employees in appreciation of a job well done. So option #2 seems more
likely.

What _is_ the company's definition of community? Clues exist other in
answers:

> We wouldn't exist without the community.

> Investment in community. Avoid being reactive.

> We need the economic engine to sustainably invest back in the
> community.

> Recently our new CEO updated the mission statement: "Helping write
> the script of the future by serving developers and technical
> workers."

> We ask, "Are communities growing?"

The genesis of the company's definition of community goes back at
least to the fall of 2015. I presented [a
talk](https://jlericson.com/2019/04/24/crack_overflow.html) at our
meetup in San Diego, which was one of the highlights of my
career. Also at that meetup I (along with the rest of the community
management team) learned the company saw community trust as an
untapped resource for generating income. For [the next two
years](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/303005/1438), the company
pursued a strategy intended to grow the business. In my opinion, it
also wasted community social capital in the attempt.[^1]

At the time, the company had [two lines of
business](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/15/how-we-make-money-at-stack-overflow-2016-edition/)[^2]:

1. Ads
2. Talent/Jobs

Over at [College Confidential](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/)
ads are our primary line of business. What you learn fairly quickly is
there are only two ways to make that business produce more revenue:

1. Increase page views (inventory)
2. Increase the price advertisers pay (quality)

Stack Overflow had already maxed out its CPM by offering valuable
customers that are otherwise hard to reach. Increasing page views was
likely to be difficult since the site had reached its peak [sometime
in
2014](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/320223/what-happened-to-stack-overflow-in-2014). Ideas
of increasing the amount of advertising on each page were floated, but
ultimately rejected.[^3] So the only option was to grow the job site
instead.

In theory, a market providing a service to the community would be
mutually beneficial. Think of Facebook Marketplace or the links to
purchase games on
[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul). Plus,
you can create more inventory by hiring more salespeople to generate
more job listings. Stack Overflow has access to pretty much all the
potential applicants for software engineering jobs. For years the
[sales pitch](https://stackoverflow.com/company) has been "[Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the largest, most trusted
online community for anyone that codes".[^4] Then it can [sell
Talent](https://stackoverflow.com/talent/en) by pointing to 50 million
visitors and 1 million resumes.

It's a great business&mdash;if the market is healthy. Employers need
to see applicants or they won't renew. So the company spent
significant resources [encouraging visitors to
register](https://jlericson.com/2017/07/28/race_to_1k_2.html) and
build out their [Developer
Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/1438). Layoffs in 2017
suggest the strategy failed.

One of the themes of the San Diego meetup was [The Leaky Bucket
Theory](https://www.clv-calculator.com/customer-retention/crm-clv/leaky-bucket-theory/).[^5]
The idea was we had all these people "mooching off" the site, not
registering, not applying for jobs and not helping us make money. We
were losing customers _because the community wasn't doing what we were
needing them to do_. And why should they? We didn't offer anything you
can't get at half a dozen other job boards. But the sales side had a
model showing how much the company could make by hiring more
salespeople and surely there was a lever to pull to get more job
applicants too.

What needed to happen was to [flip the
funnel](https://tinyletter.com/ben/letters/why-i-hate-funnels). Instead
of treating the community as potential sources of income, remember
what it was like to delight the community. And now I finally get to
the point of this post: **Meta users are difficult to deal with because
they have fully bought into Stack Exchange**. A lot them happen to be
developers (or "people who code"), but that's not their defining
feature. Meta users aren't entitled; they are passionate about the
project of bringing knowledge to the masses. They see company success
as a means to that end and nothing more.

> CEO will commit to continue posting on meta at least quarterly.

That's like the NBA commissioner saying he'll commit to being at four
games a season. Did you know that there are members of the community
who have visited the site every day for [over 10
years](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122976/anyone-with-a-visited-3652-days-3652-consecutive-in-their-profile)? 

[![A Lakers fan celebrating in front of a burning

It's easy to see the downsides of passion if you don't know what all
the excitement is about. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to see
the upside. Imagine watching a TV show that compiled 30 minutes of
your worst moments: that time you yelled at a family member, the lie
you told that you immediately regretted, the year you cheated on your
taxes. That's pretty much what it's like to read meta without grokking
why people post there.



[^1]: Obviously that's nothing compared to the last 90 days or so. 

[^2]: Enterprise came a year or so later.

[^3]: Engineers, who are the primary demographic of Stack Overflow
    ads, essentially vetoed the ideas. I suspect this set in motion
    the belief in some quarters that engineering isn't interested in
    revenue growth.

    [Originally](https://web.archive.org/web/20170701185947/https://stackoverflow.com/company)
    the audience was "developers". This is an expansion of the
    audience, but still focused on a subset of the community.
	
[^5]: So many sites explaining the concept cram ads on every inch of
    the page or put content behind a paywall. It occurs to me that's a
    helpful demonstration of the problem.
