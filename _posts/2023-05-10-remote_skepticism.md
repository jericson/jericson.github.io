It's hard to tell without context what, exactly, Sam Altman means by
"full remote forever". I'm going by news reports and assuming he means
everyone working from home with no office or with an office used by
only a few people in the company. Let me sketch what I think is the
best version of this argument:

* For virtually all of human history, people worked shoulder to
  shoulder with other people. 
* We pick up subtle cues from non-verbal communication that are not
  present when people aren't physically co-located.
* Innovations happen when people interact with each
  other. Communication barriers from remote work short-circuit that
  process.
* Technology (video meetings, chat, etc.) has not yet overcome the
  disadvantages from working remote.
  
I find these points persuasive! Especially for certain organizations
and certain people, working in the same physical space is more
productive than over a video call. It's got to be frustrating to go
into the office and find many of your co-workers are still at home. 

Speaking of which, how many of us are setting up an office in our
living room, like I am right now?[^1] Behind me our twins are watching
a YouTube video about LEGO. When I'm on a video call the lighting
makes me look like I'm in a witness protection program. Don't tell my
boss, but sometimes I play games during work hours.

My first job was an internship near Dulles Airport that was between 30
minutes to an hour from my home in Fairfax. When I started my first
full time job at JPL, it took 40 minutes to over an hour to commute
from UCLA.[^2] So my commute increased the time dedicated to work from
8 hours to 10. I listened to a lot of sports talk radio before I
discovered the library has an extensive audio book collection.

I worked with a guy who lived in South Bay and got up early to avoid
an hour and a half commute. My strategy was to go in later in the
morning. So we had roughly 4 hours of overlap during the day. Even
though we worked closely together, I estimate we spent an average of
20 minutes of that time in the same room. Most of that would be during
our weekly team meetings.

When we did talk, it might be about work. But it was more often about
sports, hobbies and, _sigh_, our commutes. I remember a long
discussion about how every application would be a website in the
future&mdash;a future that was only a few years away. We solved some
technical problems together. But going into the office mostly meant
sitting in our respective offices and doing work on our own computers.

Since we worked on multi-user Unix systems, our computers frequently
functioned as terminals. We got permission to use SSH so that we could
log in from home in case of emergency. Once we had that, there was
little need to come into work physically other than meetings. Later I
worked on a project that had a daily conference call with people
across the country. I'd get up early, check the processing from the
previous night, call in and only go to work later in the day if I had
a meeting.

I won't say going into the office had _no_ value. I learned SQL from a
co-worker during intense pair programming sessions. Another co-worker
introduced me to active listening while chatting over the wall that
separated our cubicles. What I will say that as the technology for
working remote improved, the cost of commuting became much higher
relative to just working from home. The trend has only continued
since.

Starting remote work opened up the world to me. That's not a figure of
speech. In the last decade I've worked with people from:

* The Philippines
* Japan
* Russia
* Germany
* Egypt
* Israel
* England
* Northern Ireland
* Portugal
* Brazil
* Serbia
* Romania

If I'd worked out of an office, there's no chance I could've met all
of these people, much less collaborate with them. We talk a lot about
diversity and inclusion in narrow terms: mostly race and
gender. There's a sense to that if you're focused on America's history
of sexism and racism. Remote work gives us a global understanding of
diversity by including people who live outside of the commuting
radius.

The pandemic forced a lot of people to get used to the tools of remote
communication:

* chat
* video calls
* shared documents

Each of these tools leaves artifacts as a natural part of using
them. When I've joined companies that suddenly found themselves
remote-only, it's as if they didn't exist before that moment.[^3]
History begins when people commit to writing things down.

Hybrid companies (some people are remote and others go to the office)
struggle until they discover the [one remote => all
remote](https://jlericson.com/2020/03/09/remote_tips.html#one-remote-gt-all-remote)
principle. People who call in generally have a harder time
communicating than people who meet physically. Meanwhile, when you can
just drop by someone's cubicle to resolve an issue, you don't have the
same incentive to document decisions. Not only does carefully
recording outcomes of meetings help people who can't physically be
there, it also helps participants remember what happened long after
the meeting has been forgotten.

It's not that in-office companies _can't_ produce good records. Rather
it's not natural the way it is for fully-remote companies. With some
ingenuity, office workspaces could function like their remote
counterparts. Meanwhile fully-remote companies can compensate for
what's missing from not meeting in an office by:

* Requiring weekly 1-on-1 meetings between employees and their supervisor.
* Offering regular company-wide meetups.
* Facilitating team-building activities.
* Organizing cross-team connections.

Having tried both, I don't ever want to go back to a daily
commute. The few things I'm missing are easily balanced by the many,
many ways online work environments produce better outcomes for more
people.

Now this isn't true for all types of labor. A few weeks ago a city
inspector came to examine our ongoing construction project. As we
walked around the mostly-completed framing, I had an odd feeling that
are stairs were too narrow. Since our architect was there, I asked him
and he responded that, at 3 feet wide, they complied with the building
code&mdash;barely. But, he said, the time to change plans was now;
once the concrete is poured, it gets at lot more difficult to change.

Since the architect, structural engineer and project manager were all
on-site, we were able to physically consider the ripple effects of
making the stairs wider. Half an hour later we had [a change in
plans](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/change-in-plans/181). Could we
have done this over email or Zoom? Maybe. Being in the same location,
however, made the whole process smooth and natural.

So, yeah. If your business depends on something physical (a place or
an object) get your employees in the same space so they can work
together on that thing. But if your business is online . . . do I
really need to finish the sentence? 

Companies that _can_ go fully remote don't need offices. Offices are a
distraction what with the commuting, shared kitchens, badges, hour and
a half lunch breaks, personality conflicts and stolen office
supplies. There's a _chance_ that spending time together physically
will spark creativity, but there's no guarantee. And I don't see the
evidence that spending time together using the tools of a remote
office reduces the odds of creative inspiration.

[^1]: Because of
    [construction](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/construction-begins/158),
    my office is not available.
[^2]: Later I moved to Pasadena which cut my communte to only a few
    minutes if I drove. Living so close, I did take a bus or bike
    sometimes.
[^3]: To be fair, most of that history is probably buried in email and
    files that aren't easily discovered over the internet.
