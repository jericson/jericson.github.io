Over the weekend, one of our most respected users and moderator
extraordinaire, Monica Cellio, wrote a
[post that shook me up](https://medium.com/@cellio/dear-stack-overflow-we-need-to-talk-13bf3f90204f). Please
read it if you haven't. Come back, if you like, but please read that
post first.

I'm not going to detail what happened or why; that story belongs to
others. I'm going to venture a guess from knowing Monica for years
that her words reflect a sense Stack Overflow, my employer, betrayed
her. As operators of the Stack Exchange network, it was our
responsibility to protect the volunteers who make it run from outside
threats and we failed to do that job. It doesn't much matter that the
action we took was minor in the grand scheme of things or that our
intentions were to protect the community from a different sort of
harm. We broke trust and our relationship will never be the same.

In ten years of involvement with the network and five years of
employment as a community manager, I've seen my fair share of
chaos. For instance, I
[rage quit without the rage](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/42481/the-problem-with-extrinsic-motivation).[^1]
I
[announced the shutdown of a project I believe in](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation). In
2017, good friends and valuable colleagues where
[laid off](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303005/what-happened-with-the-stack-overflow-layoffs).[^2]
For all that the company has done to enable its volunteer users to
build a store of knowledge, I wonder if it's worth all the pain we
suffered and, frankly, inflicted.

It's only right that you and I should take the time to grieve. As King

For my part, I've sensed an erosion of community capital for several
years and it's no longer a resource we can reliably draw from. At
[one point during the Documentation project](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349410/tearing-down-the-structure-of-documentation)
I had a conversation with our Product Manager about how users didn't
seem to have any confidence in us. She calmly explained that most
companies don't have that luxury at all. In order to obtain the trust
of users, most projects need to show them something they can believe
in by first meeting their needs. It's the quality of the product
that matters in almost every case. Our collaboration with users in
developing the Q&A engine was very nearly unique. It's tragic that we
are in the process of losing that unusual relationship if the damage
hasn't been done entirely.

[My analysis](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311933/1438) is that we
as an organization have taken on an unhealthy role with the developer
community and our users. I won't go into detail here, but the company
pursued its goals with the assumption that our users would be eager to
participate. And it turns out that's only really true when our goals
directly help users reach their goal to build a library of answers
to questions on whatever topic inspires them.

This is the part of the post where I turn optimistic. If you aren't
ready to follow me down this path, that's no problem. Here's an
earnest song by that band that did a music video with treadmills:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndOndyUD1kE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Are you are ready for the optimistic message? **Whatever chaos
surrounds us, we can know that it's only temporary.**[^3] I'm not sure
we can ever get back to the exciting formative years of the network,
but we don't need to despair that we'll be stuck in this particular
dysfunction either.

What's more, the idealized state of users and developers working
hand-in-hand to build the sites was more smoke-and-mirrors than
reality. When I was first hired most of the development team was
assigned to "core", which is to say, there was a bag of developers for
managers to draw from. It wasn't quite the same situation as
[Valve's no-management structure](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-ellsworth/)
but it was a lot closer to that than a typical organization. As a
semi-outsider, I observed two ways that changes got made:

1. As a result of major initiatives originated by management.
2. As the result of an employee rallying support for their idea (and
often doing the bulk of the work themselves).

I don't think this is airing dirty laundry because that's the
impression I got from observing the company even before I was
hired. Also, it's a normal part of a maturing development team, in my
experience. To the extent that initiatives and developer-selected
projects line up with user's feature requests, this can look like a
partnership.

And indeed, when the goals of the project align to some degree with
the community's goals and when the project is carried to completion
(including evaluating the end result and fixing issues) this
arrangement can be very successful. For instance, by working with
other people in the company and getting feedback from meta, I was able
to
[create a set of badges for asking questions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/234259/asking-days-badges). It
was thrilling to see through to the end and I'm incredibly pleased
with the results. But the process was very dependent on personalities
in a way that's not very efficient.

Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem:
[hire a project manager](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/343486/1438). I
don't think I'm alone in feeling a sense of relief when our
development process became more predictable and understandable. I can
now say with confidence
[what we are working on](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305560/2018-monthly-product-team-updates)
and usually
[explain our goals](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-meta)
too. There are still vestiges of the old ways[^4] that surprise us,
but generally PMs have taken responsibility to drive the development
process.

The downside of top-down development is there's a lot less room for
independent projects and _ad hoc_ feature development. As more
developers have been assigned to larger projects and as more gates are
erected, fewer of the second type of development has been possible. So
if you depend on that work to get your pet project done, more
disciplined development is bad news. For better or worse, the features
established users most appreciate tended to come from developers
pounding them out in their unallocated time.

However there's good reason to expect projects managed by a PM will
result in more polished features that get testing, validation and
incremental improvements. Take, for instance, the
[improved review queue indicator]https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/302226/how-does-the-review-needed-indicator-work-exactly). With
the previous indicator, it was difficult to explain how it worked
without combing through the code. It was a one-size-fits-all-sites
algorithm. It had
[one giant annoyance](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231051/please-dim-the-color-of-the-review-task-counter-when-there-are-no-actionable-tas)
that couldn't be easily fixed.

Contrast that with the current indicator which was initially created
in response to
[feedback on the new top bar](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/300864/1438)
(another PM-managed project[^5]). We went through
[several rounds of testing](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/304445/experiment-review-needed-indicator-logic-for-sites-that-sometimes-have-empty-qu)
before settling on the design. As recently as
[this week](https://sustainability.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/294/red-dot-for-review-queues-doesnt-go-away)
I've handled requests to tweak the logic for individual sites. Perhaps
most importantly, I can fiddle with plenty of site settings
specifically designed to accommodate the changes I'm making. Lastly,
I'm confident that we'll be able to improve on the system in the
future if we find a better way. Given we've
[documented the algorithm](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/302226/how-does-the-review-needed-indicator-work-exactly),
it's even possible users will have the information necessary to
productively suggest improvements.

There's one more effect that I think will be incredibly healthy, but
will probably scare some users. **Project priority is now controlled
by our PMs.** They
[might ask for input](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354125/help-set-qa-teamdag-product-development-priorities)
yet the ultimate decision of what to work on resides with them. Really
that's the only logical way to get work done. Only the person who
controls the schedule can make rational priorities.

I think the recent incident highlights the potential danger of people
with the loudest voices driving our development schedule. While it's
new that the voices are coming from outside our community, it wasn't a
good situation when development reacted to voices on meta
either. Plus, as I said before, a lot of that was an illusion. And so,
I have hope. Not hope that we'll return to the old way of
doing things. Rather I have hope that we'll find an even better path.
