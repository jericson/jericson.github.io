On January 6, 2021, I had a meeting with a colleague about making some
changes to the [College Confidential
rules](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/policies/rules/). She
wanted to know what I thought the purpose of the rules are and I
answered:

> Wisdom doesn't scale.

Actually I said "Wise people don't scale" which is both more accurate
and more ambiguous. I don't mean that wise people reject the concept of
scaling (though that does seem smart). Instead I mean something like
[the problem Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
observed](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.13-18?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en):

> Next day, Moses sat as magistrate among the people, while the people
> stood about Moses from morning until evening. But when Moses'
> father-in-law saw how much he had to do for the people, he said,
> "What is this thing that you are doing to the people? Why do you act
> alone, while all the people stand about you from morning until
> evening?"
>
> Moses replied to his father-in-law, "It is because the people come
> to me to inquire of God. When they have a dispute, it comes before
> me, and I decide between one person and another, and I make known
> the laws and teachings of God."
>
> But Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing you are doing is
> not right; you will surely wear yourself out, and these people as
> well. For the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone."

In other words, even a man who has _a direct connection to God_ can't
moderate a large community alone. Eventually [the task gets too
heavy](https://jlericson.com/2015/04/06/customer-support-3.html#be-lenient-when-possible). [Jethro's
solution](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.19-22?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en)
was to delegate, which is a fantastic way to encourage community
peace. Many sites designate moderators from within the
community. Stack Overflow takes it one step further by [deputizing
regular
users](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/). [Discourse
uses trust
levels](https://jlericson.com/2020/09/15/cc_moderation.html) for a
similar effect. Since many people can flag posts, there's less need
for individuals to argue with each other. If you disagree: flag. In
addition, by-standers can also flag posts if they see conversations
getting heated.

Those flags can be handled automatically in certain cases or they will
be passed on to moderators. Moderators are selected (or sometimes
[elected](https://jlericson.com/2016/02/20/stv.html)) from the
community for their level-headed judgment. But this isn't always
so. Sometimes a moderator fails to be moderate and so it's helpful to
have someone (such as myself) to watch over a team of moderators and,
when the occasion arises, remove one of their members.

There is an analogy to recent political events. When a person in
authority proves unfit for the responsibility or puts their own gain
before the good of the nation, they must be removed. When this fails
to happen, it lowers the trust people have in their leaders. On the
other hand, removing a leader for purely political (or personal)
reasons lowers trust too. Needless to say, this also requires wisdom.

In Exodus God offers another solution: the law. At their best, laws
not only constrain the wicked, but encourage the responsible. If they
are written by wise people, they _can scale_. Simple principles such
as separation of power and clearly defined standards allow a legal
system to serve people well even after it's creators have left. Indeed
the Mosaic laws are [still in active
use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) around the world.

Unfortunately laws truly do seem to made to be broken. Or at least
skirted a bit. Every set of rules will have ambiguities and
contradictions. That includes [one of my favorite legal
codes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293213/why-we-dont-keep-public-records-of-suspensions)
that consists of:

1. Be honest.
2. Be nice.

Let me tell you, there are many ways to misinterpret these simple
principles. So you need people (functionally, judges) to interpret
rules and apply them to novel situations perhaps [making new
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) in the process. And so
even simple rules are subject to change over time. And once again,
this requires wise people.

In the end, there is no escape. Injustice happens with or without wise
leaders and good law. And so we muddle through. Sometimes things go
well and other times they do not. Always we must adapt to changes in
society to create just laws and enforce them fairly. There will always
be a shortage of wisdom and an endless supply of fools.
