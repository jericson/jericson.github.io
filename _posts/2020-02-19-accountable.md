This post started as [a Twitter
thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1230268701510733824.html). It
was written before I wrote [my one-sided
retrospective](/2020/04/03/pronoun_retro.html), which might help give
context.

This is the aspect of this whole thing that keeps me up at night even
now. (Well, _tonight_ I couldn't sleep because of jet lag, but it has
caused me to write about my old job in the middle of the night over
the last few weeks.) For me there are specific people who hurt my
trust in the company. They played different roles and I believe most
were acting out of what they thought was their duty rather than
malice. Still, it's difficult to believe the company won't betray my
trust again.

I've avoided calling out individuals in my writing. That's not my
place. At least not today. The one time I thought it was my duty was
during the "retrospective". (For some reason it was not allowed to be
called a "post mortem". Perhaps because the damage was still
happening.) It came weeks later than I'd hoped and was hampered by a
directive to not compile a timeline of events shortly after they
happened. (Fortunately, CMs had been keeping a timeline and we'd
written tons of emails at the time of these events.)

The retrospective was facilitated by an employee who
didn't have much context about the events, but they did a fantastic
job of creating a blameless environment for the truth to come out. We
discovered dropped responsibilities that had happened months before.


By the way, we were following a variation of [Etsy's blameless
postmortems](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/). Reading
about the process, I was very impressed, but using it (sample size 1)
I'm not so sure. It didn't seem effective at providing closure to
those who were most harmed. I mean the CMs literally got on a call
after the retrospective and said to each other "We're never going to
get closure, are we?"

I should note that:
* the driving force behind blameless postmortems is no longer at the
  company
* the person who revealed the dropped responsibilities is no longer at
  the company
* three CMs are no longer at the company
* the people who dropped the ball are at the company.

We nailed the blameless, but not the just culture.

And despite two sessions over something like 3 hours, the root cause
of our company's failure never came close to being revealed. I'm
listening to [The History of English
Podcast](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/) and the episodes about
discovering Indo-European resonate. Rather than having a real history
of what happened, the CMs were left to piece together the unwritten
past based on whatever texts are left in view. This isn't how you do
accountabilityâ€”the truth was hidden.

I'm about to talk about two models of accountability and I want to
make clear that the situation at Stack Overflow is nothing like the
literal violence that precipitated the two models. But it is a
microcosm of those events and point to ways of building trust after
times of hurt.

The first is the [Nuremberg
trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials) of Nazis after
the end of WWII. (Again, this is far more extreme than SO. I'm talking
about the model of accountability.) In many ways, this was
accountability by retribution. War criminals were executed for their
crimes.

The second is [The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa))
in the aftermath of Apartheid. (Still more extreme harm than done by
SO leadership.) This is accountability by, well, reconciliation. Many
perpetuators were given amnesty.


I bring this up because there are people at the company who I no
longer trust to make decisions in regard to the community. I said it
back in the fall via private emails and I said it again the week I
left the company in a private document I shared with executives.

I'm not asking for those people to be fired, but am asking for them to
be held accountable to the community. I don't want retribution (which
will only feel cathartic for a moment) but reconciliation (which will
restore trust).  In fact, I strongly suspect several people I blame
for this disaster were constrained by forces unseen which I can only
guess at. If the truth were to come out, I might have more sympathy
for these people and even learn to trust them again.

Perhaps some of this reconciliation is happening now within the
company. Perhaps they have turned a hopeful corner. If so, I'm
glad. That may very well be a prerequisite for community healing. But
I also know the culture of Stack Overflow has been highly resistant to
painful truths being made public. People in the company say they value
transparency, but when it comes to mistakes by people in authority the
watchword is "secrecy". Talking with other alumni, I've learned far
more than I wanted to know about hurtful behavior by managers and
executives that was swept under the rug. It's distressing.

I don't want to be a downer during a hopeful moment in the community's
history. I want to celebrate real steps forward. But I also know there
are forces that were at work as recently as my last day at the company
that protect people who caused the community deep hurt.
