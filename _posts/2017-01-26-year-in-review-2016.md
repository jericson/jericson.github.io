By almost every measure, more Stack Exchange users shared more
knowledge in 2016 than any previous year. Perhaps the most direct
metric is the 4.5 million answers posted across our 162 sites. We
couldn't get those answers without a stream of new questions: 3.6
million last year alone. You might argue that not all of those posts
are useful and it's true users gave out 3.6 million downvotes. But I'd
respond that askers accepted 1.5 million answers as fixing their
problem and 24.9 million upvotes show many more people got helpful
information. We have a strong culture of continuous improvement as
evidenced by 5.1 million edits and 4.4 million completed reviews. Many
of last year's 14.4 million comments, which are intended to clarify
rather than be conversational, added information above and beyond the
posts themselves. 

Stack Overflow represented the bulk of network activity with 2.6
million questions. Our generous community of programmers provided 3.1
million answers of which 1.1 million were accepted. There were 2.4
million downvotes and 16.8 million upvotes. Seasoned users completed
2.9 million review tasks in order to keep the content looking its
best. Some of last year's 3.4 million edits were prompted by 9.9
million clarifying and annotating comments. If you compare those
numbers to the [previous
year](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/01/year-in-review-2015/), you
might notice Stack Overflow's numbers are flat. We think we've
saturated our current audience and should be looking at groups who
feel marginalized or poorly-served by the system today. One obvious
direction is to expand into other languages:

* [Portuguese](http://pt.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Japanese](http://ja.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Russian](http://ru.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Spanish](http://es.stackoverflow.com/)

Collectively, our non-English Stack Overflow sites have grown from 55k
questions asked in 2015 to 70k in 2016. That 26% increase indicates
there's a thirst for people to learn and share knowledge in the
language they regularly use. (I know. Shocking!) Q&A tends to be
somewhat competitive and adversarial. This means that users often get
answers to their questions within minutes. But not everyone enjoys
that sort of activity. So we are experimenting with another way to
contribute to the art and science of programming. We call it
[Documentation](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/07/Introducing-Stack-Overflow-Documentation-Beta/). In
its first year, users have created 21,954 examples organized in 6761
topics and representing [890
tags](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation). Our vision of
Documentation will only succeed when many developers pitch in with
improving edits. So it's encouraging that 10,238 users have
contributed 49,486 approved changes (including initial submissions) to
those topics. [Looking ahead to
2017](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/339974/the-dawn-of-documentation-a-solstice-update),
we are shifting from building the technical infrastructure to building
a strong community. [Come help
us!](http://stackoverflow.com/tour/documentation)

![ELL error image](/images/d2f6d19bb73be64a6e171c2930a638275947d15e-500x351.png)

We're growing in terms of topic area too. Last year we graduated 5 sites from beta status:

* [Law](http://law.stackexchange.com/)
* [Motor Vehicle Maintenance & Repair](http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/)
* [Philosophy](http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/)
* [Programming Puzzles & Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)
* [Puzzling](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/)

The last two are particularly interesting as they push the boundaries
of traditional Q&A. Instead of asking questions they *don't* know the
answers to, our puzzle sites are for people to pose challenges for
others to solve. The Code Golf site has been doing this for years, so
official graduation is long-awaited accomplishment. I'm also pleased
to report that we have a [site for Software
Engineering](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/). This site
has been around since 2010, but you might not have known what it was
about. That's because the site was called Programmers. (And old-timers
recall it started out as [Not Programming
Related](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3352/not-programming-related). It's
a long story.) Besides being a better fit for the site's community,
we've heard from regular users that new users are more likely to grok
the scope of the community.

The [most viewed questions on Stack
Exchange](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/613285/top-viewed-questions-by-year?limit=10&year=2016)
tend to reflect technology trends:

1. [How do I get Pokemon Go to detect my phones
   orientation?](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/272904/how-do-i-get-pokemon-go-to-detect-my-phones-orientation)

Meanwhile, the [best content according to
voting](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/613286/top-answers-by-score-or-the-year?limit=10&year=2016)
tends to be more evergreen:

If you enjoy analyzing data about the Stack Exchange network, 2016 was
your year. Community member Monica Cellio wrote a [tutorial about our
data
explorer](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/06/learn-more-about-your-site-with-the-se-data-explorer-heres-how/),
which is maintained by another community member, Tim Stone. A resident
data scientist, David Robinson, released
[StackLite](http://varianceexplained.org/r/stack-lite/), a lightweight
version of community data. To see it in action, consider [scripting
language
trends](https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/so-trends/?tags=perl+python+ruby+powershell+bash)
on Stack Overflow. In December, we connected our data to [Google's
BigQuery](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/12/You-Can-Now-Play-With-Stack-Overflow-Data-on-Googles-BigQuery/). People
are already finding [interesting
results](https://hackernoon.com/which-programming-languages-have-the-happiest-and-angriest-commenters-ebe91b3852ed#.rhvq5so58). Our
data team has been [posting
analysis](http://stackoverflow.blog/tags/data/) on the blog, if you
crave more. 

In addition to making user-created content more accessible, we've also
been working on being more open about how we operate as a company. We
[discovered](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/07/salary-transparency/)
that salary transparency helps [companies recruit
employees](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies?utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=dev-c4al&utm_content=c4al-link),
so we made [our salary calculation
public](https://stackoverflow.com/company/salary/calculator). Since we
strive to pay developers fairly, there's really no downside. There's
no real downside to [sharing our business
model](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/How-We-Make-Money-at-Stack-Overflow-2016-Edition/)
either. For one thing, being successful as a company means we can keep
[our servers
running](http://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/03/29/stack-overflow-the-hardware-2016-edition/). For
another, the products themselves further our larger goal of improving
the computer programming profession. The [Jobs
product](http://stackoverflow.blog/2015/12/Bringing-Jobs-to-Stack-Overflow/)
eliminates inefficiencies in the developer hiring process, so we are
pleased to promote it (while improving it further). We even think our
advertisements make our sites better by [being respectful and
relevant](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/02/Why-Stack-Overflow-Doesnt-Care-About-Ad-Blockers/). 

Now I was tempted to not talk about
[Enterprise](https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/enterprise), which
is our Q&A product for large organizations. As long as I have worked
here we've steered people away from it because it's so expensive and
we assumed it didn't work. But then we started hearing reports of
companies hosting thriving communities sharing internal knowledge. (We
probably should have guessed based on experience with [smaller
sites](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites).)
At any rate, Enterprise is now a product we actively support and sell
to large organizations. And just to be sure it works for others, we've
started using an internal instance to collect and preserve company
lore. 

Last year we [redesigned the
resume](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/10/Bye-Bye-Bullets-The-Stack-Overflow-Developer-Story-is-the-New-Technical-Resume/)
which allows programmers to show off what they've done whether or not
they are looking for work. In 2016, 278,455 users updated their
Developer Story. (If you aren't among that number, why not [try it
out](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/01/26/year-in-review-2016/s.tk/story)?)

Like Socrates, Stack Overflow Inc. serves as a [midwife to
knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-theaetetus/#SumDia). We
don't create informative content; we merely manage the systems that
enable users to build up a corpus of knowledge. As such, we depend on
users to report issues on meta. Across Stack Exchange, there were
2,365 bugs or features marked as [status-completed] in 2016. Our most
popular change (by the voting) was [allowing users to cancel
misclicked
flags](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/87500/cancel-misclicked-flags). It
was also the [third most
popular](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/252155/add-ability-to-cancel-flags). We
can't implement all the ideas users send us, so we reluctantly
rejected 322 meta posts. The most popular was my idea to [hide trivial
comments](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/204402/hide-trivial-comments). (I
still like the idea, but we haven't been able to find a reliable way
to evaluate the costs and benefits.) 


If you want more statistics about meta questions we've responded to,
please see [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnkNz9Ug1GZVK_gs7Co-EWyoTzZ-xtjsfxpuqMd6kqk/edit#gid=1037209376)
compiled by my colleague, JNat. JNat also organizes our process for
making small- to medium-scale changes that benefit our existing
communities. Some of these changes (14 last year) help us in the
[Community
Team](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99338/who-are-the-community-managers-and-what-do-they-do)
do our jobs more efficiently. Others benefit our team of volunteer
moderators (30). But the majority (55) are intended to help people in
the community itself. For example, you can now [chose which
site](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/254566/dont-force-sync-with-my-oldest-account-on-my-network-profile)
to use for your network profile. We also support [hiding
sites](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267121/hiding-sites-from-the-main-stackexchange-com-profile-page)
if you don't want the world to easily discover your obsession with [3D
Printing](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/). For those who are
curious, JNat has [another
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10iK3AW0H0rN8_wQDKAQxDTyTF9gpC7i6dNZqYHtwAac/edit?usp=sharing)
that details the changes made last year. 

Here at Stack Exchange, we have a few annual traditions:

* In January, 56k developers took our [annual
  survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016). (Please
  take [**this year's
  survey**](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VJ7R7K7), if you haven't
  already!)
* On April 1, our very own Adam Lear kicked off our newest product
  line: indie games! [Unikong](https://unikong.github.io/) is an
  old-school platformer that pits our [highest reputation
  user](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet) against trolls
  as he attempts to tame a wild unicorn. (Pro-tip: jump off coins for
  greater height.)
* We [gave $50,900 to
  charity](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/12/Stack-Overflow-Gives-Back-2016/)
  on behalf and at the direction of our volunteer moderators.
* Our annual [Winter Bash
  event](http://stackoverflow.blog/2017/01/say-farewell-to-winter-bash-2016/)
  was a smashing success as more users than ever donned digital dome
  decorations.

2016 marked a year of growing potential for Stack Exchange. While [not
everything](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/330427/the-un-shipping-of-teams)
we tried last year worked out, we’ve planted seeds that will bear
fruit in 2017 and beyond. More importantly, our amazing communities
continue to build (and curate) a massive collection of informative
answers.
