To cut the to chase: I'm not planning on updating this blog for a
bit. If you want to read what I'm writing now, I recommend visiting:

1. [The Civitas
   Community](https://beta.buildcivitas.com/t/announcing-the-civitas-community/55)
   where I write about community building.
2. [Meta Jon](https://meta.jlericson.com/) where I write about topics
   that I'm interested in with no particular goal in mind.
   
This blog started as a place for me to write about my work at Stack
Exchange without needing to worry about getting approval. I've written
222 posts[^1] about everything from [supporting small
communities](/2024/01/05/popup_communities.html)
to [my favorite board
games](/2023/10/02/top10.html). I'm incredibly
proud of my output and I'd love to keep working on it. So why am I
taking a break?

I guess the big issue is that I can't justify writing my blog now that
[I have a business to
run](https://beta.buildcivitas.com/t/my-approach-to-community-consulting/68). Writing
about community on my business' community platform might conceivably
help me pay my bills, but this blog is just a step too far from that
imperative. It's a luxury I can't currently afford.

One of the things I love about this blog is that it serves static
pages. As a result, it's [quite
responsive](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-jlericson-com/i7xrj2wzih?hl=en&form_factor=mobile):

If people want to respond to what I write, they need to [log into my
personal Discourse
instance](https://meta.jlericson.com/c/blog-comments/5). Because the
site needs to be built from data in the database, [the performance
isn't as
snappy](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-meta-jlericson-com/2pxbb65r49?hl=en&form_factor=mobile):

The upside, of course, is that people can respond without moving to a
new site. And I can use [all the features of
Discourse](/2023/12/08/why_discourse.html) to do
interesting things such as [create architecture
diagrams](https://beta.buildcivitas.com/t/build-civitas-architecture/56). In
the past I would have worked on adding those features to my blog as a
hobby. Now I'm learning how to help clients by exploring Discourse.

This post was inspired by _Dear Mr. Watterson_, a documentary about
_Calvin & Hobbes_. I highly recommend it!
