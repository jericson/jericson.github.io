 This is a followup to City of Chains, but not as competent or interesting. Annoyingly, I spent several minutes in the hub/hideout area not finding a way to advance. (It's a computer terminal on the back wall.) Once in the dungeon areas, movement is nothing more than chosing a direction. Most rooms are empty and there's no way to tell which direction will have something interesting. So you mostly wander around until you feel like taking on the final encounter.
 

 

 It's possible that more playing time will reveal more interesting decisions. But the core game just isn't interesting enough to find out.
