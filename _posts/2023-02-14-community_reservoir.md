[This is the first of a regular series of articles about the College
Confidential community. I'm writing them for an internal audience and
this is a slightly edited version for an external audience.]

I've [compared communities to hydroelectric
dams](https://jlericson.com/2021/03/23/2021_CMX_report.html) in the
sense that they're difficult to get started yet provide ongoing value if
well maintained. To extend the metaphor a little bit, the reservoir
behind a dam works like any group of people. People flow into groups via
inlets and leave via outlets. The size of a group continually changes as
people come and go. This is true of all types of groups, not just online
communities.

My wife is a leader in Cub Scouts. People find out about the pack via
Facebook, personal recommendation, membership drives and flyers at
school. Every year many families join and many families leave. Usually
they leave because their children age out of the program. But they also
leave because they are moving out of state or just lose interest. It's
not much different from College Confidential in that respect.

## Inlets

Google Analytics provides a useful summary of how people come to
CC:[^1]

![](/images/cc_channels.png)

A quick summary of what those channels represent:

-   Organic search is people entering a search term into Google (or
    Bing, I suppose)
-   Direct means the person typed the URL directly or used a
    bookmark.[^2]
-   Referrals come from sites that link to CC, which aren't social media
    sites.
-   Social covers Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
-   Email means the traffic comes from an email we sent out with a UTM
    tag.[^3]

Because of the way Google Analytics is set up, links from
[https://www.collegeconfidential.com/](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/)
are counted as Referral. \~80% of referral traffic comes from the WWW
side of CC. We can infer that many (and perhaps, most) of those people
are already CC forum users who are simply navigating around the site.
Most Direct traffic is also likely to be people who are already part of
the community.

With 87% of traffic coming from organic search, Google is our primary
source of visitors. This is typical for mature communities and CC has
been around for 2 decades. Early on it was the only place to get
information about college admissions. Now we are competing with reddit,
social media and the schools' websites for search traffic. To bring it
back to the reservoir analogy, new dams have been built upstream from us
to divert flows away from CC.

Our dependence on Google for traffic is not unique, but we do have
advantages because we offer interactive discussion. If you can't find
what you\'re looking for, you can start a discussion. Google is
beginning to [recognize the value of
forums](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-discussions-forums-news/)
and members of the community continue to add to our content library for
minimal cost. New content relevant to our audience is the best way to
attract more search traffic, so it's a virtuous cycle.

I anticipate search will be the topic of a future community insight
article. But to summarize: **Nearly all of CC's new users come from
Google.**

## Outlets

"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own
way."

---Leo Tolstoy, [*Anna
Karenina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle)

There are many ways for people to drop out of CC. Perhaps the healthiest
is when students complete their education or parents run out of
college-age children. College Confidential served its purpose and people
move on.[^4] We can think of this as the water that runs through the
turbines and generates the power of the community. If we've genuinely
helped students and their families, the community has provided value.
This is the best way to sell CC to the next generation.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have people who visit CC a few
times and never return. Think of this as evaporation---that outlet
provides little value. An easy-to-categorize type of pageviews come from
bots/crawlers. Those will never convert to active users, but we do get
value from them because they index the site so that search engines can
show our pages to people looking for information. (Remember, this is our
top source of new users.)

![](/images/cc_pageviews.png)

Metrics like bounce rate give us an idea of how many people leave on
their first visit. All other things being equal, we want lower bounce
rates. What we really want to know, however, is how many people come
back to the site over and over again. Unfortunately, we can't easily
track individual visitors before they register.[^5]

Before going on, I do need to point out two oddities with our data:

1.  We changed platforms for the forums in November, 2020. As a result
    we do not have easy access to data about anonymous users before that
    month.
2.  From June, 2021 to June, 2022 CC required registration in order to
    browse the site.[^6]

The result is a natural experiment on the behavior of lurkers. Before we
required registration to browse, 18% of non-bot traffic came from
registered users. After we required registration, the rate
increased to a max of 60% as regular readers had a reason to register.
It fluctuated a fair amount, however. The average for that period was
38%. Almost all of the anonymous traffic in this period was from people
who visited only a few pages or who used ad-blocking technology.

After we removed the registration wall, the rate of registered pageviews
stabilized at around 46%. Since nearly all of our regular lurkers had
converted to registered users or left the site, we can estimate what
proportion of pageviews come from people who read the site regularly,
but don't contribute. Normally these people wouldn't bother to register.
So if we assume \~18% of pageviews still come from contributors, we can
estimate that \~28% of pageviews come from regular readers who don't
post.

From the perspective of community management, traffic from lurkers is
like the water that's released downstream via a spillway. It's not
driving the engine of the community (posts) so it doesn't help our
growth. That said, this traffic can be very valuable for other parts of
the business such as advertising and lead generation. It's just that the
greater benefit comes from people who contribute to the site in some
way.

Outside of the period where we required registration to read the site,
people generally register only when they intend to contribute in some
way. So another outlet happens when people register, but don't
contribute. Because of the seasonality of the college application
process, the rate of people who contribute at least one post in the 30
days after they register varies. In the summer months, we see
about 35% of registered users contribute. In March, during peak decision
season, the rate is closer to 60%.

![](/images/CC_contribution_rate.png)

The rather dramatic dropoff from June 2021 to June 2022 coincides with
the registration wall. Many people who had no intention of contributing
registered so that they could read the site. One might hope that they
would decide to contribute now that they had an account to do so, but
very few actually did. The jump from lurking to contributing has always
been large.

Finally we have people who register, maybe contribute for a while and
then leave for whatever reason. Again this is highly seasonal. People
who register in March tend to be students who want to interact with
other students who applied to the same schools they did. After regular
decision season, those students don't see any reason to stick around.
Meanwhile, students who register in the fall, tend to stick around at
least through the end of decision season.


![](/images/CC_retention_rate.png)


I should point out that both the contribution rate and retention rate
increased rather dramatically from November 2020 to June 2021. This was
the time from when we moved from Vanilla Forums to Discourse. The more
modern platform offers many features that encourage participation. In
addition, the old forums looked very much as if they had been
transported in from the early 2000s. (No surprise since that's exactly
what had happened.) By providing a more familiar looking platform, we
increased the odds people would contribute and stick around.

## Summary

College Confidential gets almost all of its incoming traffic via Google
search.

People leave the site when they:

1.  immediately bounce off of the page they land on.
2.  read the content on the site, but never decide to register.
3.  register, but never contribute.
4.  contribute for a short period of time, but stop returning.
5.  complete their college admission journey and move onto other
    pursuits in life.

In the long run, increasing contribution and retention rates will
increase the quantity and quality of content on CC. That, in turn, is
the best way to bring in new visitors via search traffic.

[^1]:  This is just the forums. The WWW section is 58% Organic Search
    and 32% Direct.

[^2]:  These days it is likely they started to type the URL and it
    turned up as an autocomplete option.

[^3]:  If I send an email with a CC link, it won't have a UTM and will
    be counted as Direct instead.

[^4]:  Our most dedicated users are parents whose children have grown
    up. It's important to understand that these folks care deeply about
    the next generation and also have formed friendships on CC. This
    isn't a goal for us, but it's a sign of a strong and vibrant
    community.

[^5]:  This isn't even about privacy policies. If I visit a site from my
    work computer, again on my phone during lunch and a third time from
    my personal laptop at home, I will look like three different people.

[^6]:  I wrote about this [on my
    blog](https://jlericson.com/2022/10/14/registration_drives.html).
