I'm writing this review having never played Ares Expedition with other
people. In my defense, there are just two points of player
interaction:

1. At the start of each turn, each player selects one of their five
   phase cards and everyone reveals them at the same time. Then
   everyone can do all the revealed phases. There's a bonus for the
   phase you picked, which means each turn starts with a difficult
   decision. If you believe someone else will activate a phase you
   need, you can decide to pick another phase to collect the bonus.
2. Everyone works to increase the three global parameters: heat,
   oxygen and oceans. After the phase in which a parameter has been
   maxed out, it's no longer possible to gain points that way. So
   there's an incentive to build an engine to increase parameters that
   nobody else is working on. Alternatively, you might be earning
   points in other ways and prefer the pace of terraforming to slow.

It's not hard to spot the lineage of [Race for the
Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy) in the
first point[^1] and [the original Terraforming
Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) in
the second. The rest of the game is a deck of 200+ cards that can be
played into a tableau. Each player has their own set of cards
representing projects their corporation has completed in their efforts
to claim a high score. Gameplay consists of each player managing their
own collection without much need to see what others are doing.

Solo mode handles the two points of interaction by introducing a dummy
phase deck and making terraforming Mars the sole victory
condition. Five times through the dummy deck[^2], 25 turns, and the
game is over. Is Mars terraformed? If yes, congratulations! If no,
tough luck. Either way, the score is, at best, an interesting aside.

Ares Expedition progresses on the schedule one would imagine actual
terraforming would follow. Mars starts dry, lifeless and cold. That
doesn't change much as corporations build infrastructure. In the
fiction of the game, private companies earn MC[^3] income by creating
moneymaking projects and from subsidies awarded for increasing global
parameters. Some projects make future projects cheaper to build[^4]
and others trigger bonuses when certain conditions are met.

Some cards grant income (MC, heat or plants) based on the number of
cards deployed with specific symbols. For instance, there is a Cartel
card that increases your MC income based on the number of cards tagged
with the Earth symbol. Once you tap into the Cartel, you start looking
for Earth-based projects to pump up your income. I'm not sure how
realistic this is, but it sure is thematic.

Whether you complete each of the global parameters in the time
allotted depends largely on whether your collection of completed
projects efficiently work together. Part of the joy of Ares Expedition
comes from discovering winning strategies. For instance, you might:

1. Acquire titanium to lower the cost of space projects.
2. Plan expensive events that dump asteroids, comets and even Mars'
   own moons on the surface of the planet.
3. Use a special ability (from the Helion corporation or the Power
   Infrastructure project) to convert heat into money.
   
In fact, you might use all three of these strategies in concert since
most of the events in the deck are space projects and cost quite a
bit. When playing solitaire, it's necessary to have a plan to increase
all three global constants. Standard actions, which are always
available as a fallback, just cost too much. Failing to build projects
that generate heat, oxygen and oceans during the Action phase will
almost certainly cost you the game.

Score doesn't matter in solo games, so there are a number of cards
that don't have much value. Other cards are too expensive for what
they are worth since the costs assume score matters. Still other cards
turn into deep bargains with a meaningless score penalty. The game
requires evaluating which projects are worth building and discarding
the rest. It's not a tightly balanced game.

I do see a potential criticism of the game when played against others
that doesn't really exist as a solo experience. If a player lucks into
a decent combination of cards early on, they will enjoy a definite
advantage throughout. The rules specify a few cards that should be
used for the first time you play the game, which give a more even
start. After that, you should play with the "advanced" rules that
allow players to discard and replace any number of cards in their
initial hand before picking from the two corporations they were
dealt. This won't solve the randomness problem completely, but does go
a long way to mitigating it.

The other a way out of a bad start is through research. My first phase
choice in solitaire is always Research, which allows me (with the
bonus for using the phase card) to draw five new cards and keep
two. Between the ten card hand limit and the restriction from using
the same phase twice in a row, I do need to deploy cards between
research phases. If I'm lucky, the dummy deck will turn up the
Research card when I play Development or Construction so I get another
draw 2/keep 1 phase.

Since cards can be sold for 3 MC at any time, it's advantageous to
research early. (By the end of the game, 3 MC isn't that big of a
deal.) I can't prove it, but I get the feeling that every time I've
lost a solo game, I could have won with a bit more research. Making
Mars livable won't just require good ideas, but the right combination
of ideas. It's possible humanity won't ever find a combination that
works. You can't fight physics and expect to always win.

Ares Expedition works for me because. and not in spite of, the giant
pile of cards that might not come out in an order that facilitates an
efficient engine. I said in [my review of
Wingspan](https://jlericson.com/2019/12/29/review-wingspan.html):

> Maybe I haven't figured out the nuances of the game, but too many
> decisions seem to be inconsequential.

Thinking about it, what I'd want from Wingspan is a lot less worrying
about whether I've acquired the right food for my birds and a lot more
time digging through the bird cards to find interesting
combinations. That's exactly what Ares has done. 

The engine exists so that your discoveries mean something and only
tangentially so that you win the game. I can understand preferring a
shorter, more balanced, cleaner game like Race for the Galaxy, but
that comparison misses the point. Terraforming Mars functions in the
hard science fiction space where sometimes the best plans fail.

A few things I've discovered playing the game:

I initially bought the game from Target, but returned it when I found
the "Collectors Edition" was on sale for the same price. This version
of the game has trays for holding the cubes and tiles. It also
features double-layer player mats that corral the cubes that collect
there. By the end of the game, you'll be getting dozens of cubes in
the Production phase and it's all too easy to knock them into the
wrong section of the board even with the indentation.

I printed up [a fan-designed game
board](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/225253/revised-game-board-larger-everything)
that's easier to use than the one that came in the box. The game comes
with 5 phase tiles that don't serve much purpose playing solo. (I'm
well aware of what phase card the dummy has turned up.) I use those
tiles to keep track of how many times through the deck I've gone
instead.

In the final time through the dummy deck, I just lay out the dummy
phase cards in order face up. (The rules allow you to order the cards
how you want rather than shuffle in the last 5 turns.) My usual order is:

1. Research
2. Development
3. Production
4. Action
5. Construction

Putting Construction at the end gives me the option to deploy an event
card in the final turn, if I have one. Typically, my own phases
alternate between Action and Production to run my engine as often as
possible.

The player mat includes counters for the various incomes. I find those
helpful, but I always recalculate just before doing Production because
I often forget to update when I play a card. It can be handy when
planning ahead to have an idea of your income, but it really only
matters in the Production phase.

Footnotes:

[^1]: Well, also the second in that there are two ways to end the
    game: take the last victory point chip or place the
    12<sup>th</sup> card in their tableau,

[^2]: The rules suggest difficulty levels that allow you to add one or
    two to oxygen or heat between each reset of the dummy deck. I play
    with no bonus (expert mode) and I don't mind losing a lot more
    times than winning.
    
[^3]: Technically "Mega Credits", but I like to think it stands for
    either Martian Cash or Mars Coin.
    
[^4]: Steel reduces the cost of cards with the building tag and
    titanium reduces the cost of card tagged with the space symbol.
