[Kurtis Beavers](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/278865/kurtis-beavers),
one of our designers, asked the community team about design decisions
that encourage empathy. Paradoxically, I immediately identified one of
the most reviled features on Stack Overflow: downvotes. People so
dislike being downvoted that we have three separate
[Zendesk macros]({%post_url 2015-03-13-customer-support-1%})
explaining the role of downvotes in our system. Many of the earliest
feature requests were variations of
"[Force user to comment on downvote](https://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/forums/1722-general/suggestions/41056-force-user-to-comment-on-downvote)". Not
many people seem to think downvotes encourage empathy.

And yet, they almost certainly do. As I wrote back in
[March, 2009](https://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/forums/1722-general/suggestions/133310-discourage-downvoting):

That's not exactly the most coherent argument. To put it more
concretely, people tend to pick the path of least resistance. If I see
a nonsensical post, I have a wide range of options on a Stack Exchange
site:

* Down vote
* Flag
* Vote to close (if a question)
* Vote to delete
* Write a critical comment
* Write a scathing answer attacking the premise (if a question)

On many other sites, my only options are:

* Write a critical reply
* Do nothing

Most people on most sites do nothing but, perhaps, passively read the
page. It's not a stretch to say only the most passionate people bother
leaving feedback. For every person who comments, answers, edits or
even votes on a Stack Overflow question,
[hundreds more view it](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/309028/views-per-action).
When a question is objectively bad as measured by downvotes, it's
[more common](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/309054#graph)
for people to go out of their way to vote, comment or edit the
question to improve it.  Invested users feel responsible to do
something about content that doesn't fit on the site. Stack Overflow
gives those users many options other than leaving an unhelpful
comment.

In my experience, critical comments tend to cause the most animosity
within a community. I don't really blame people for reacting poorly to
criticism no matter how constructive. When I was answering a lot of
questions on Stack Overflow, I remember getting comments from people
pointing out that my code would break if there were spaces in a file
name. My gut reaction was something along the lines of:

> What sort of idiot puts spaces in their file names? _Windows_
> programmers?

This was particularly unfair because _I was using Windows_. So
even when comments politely point out a real problem with a post, it
hurts.

Downvotes _also_ hurt. But in my (somewhat limited) experience, extra
downvotes hurt less and less. More importantly, they cause me to make
a calculation: do I still think my post is worth risking more
downvotes or have I changed my mind? For instance, a few years ago on
our Skeptics site I answered the question
"[Is there any verifiable historical and/or scientific evidence that Moses lived?](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/4112/3252)"
I get a downvote every six months or so and each time I reconsider my
answer. So far, I've not changed anything substantial, but the
downvotes really cause me to think twice. I also get the occasional
critical comment, which I'm afraid I don't take very well. I'd rather
have people express their disagreement with a simple anonymous vote
instead.
