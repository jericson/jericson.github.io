I got an email from a reader a few months ago. My reply got a little
long and off-topic to what the reader had asked about. So I'm posting
here and will email a copy to the reader too. The actual question is,
I think, easy enough to guess and not terribly necessary to understand
my response.

Hello,

Thank you for responding to my blog post. In many ways I write for
myself and it's always a bit surprising when what I say resonates with
someone else. [Why I left Stack
Overflow](/2020/01/17/leaving_stack.html) might be an exception. I
specifically wrote it to let the community know what was happening
with me and to serve as a companion to [my post on Meta Stack
Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342424/change-in-roles-for-jon-ericson-leaving-se). I
felt more free to say certain things on my own platform. I also wanted
to influence the direction of the company with my departure. In my
view the executives running Stack Overflow failed the company, the
community and their own investors. My hope was that I would be able to
say things in a way that would challenge assumptions without being so
harsh as to turn people off from listening.

I suspect your email is specifically referring to this paragraph:

The two links are important. The first is to my autobiographical essay
on how jobs have found me more often than the other way around. The
second is a link to a page raising money for a fellow CM who had been
fired earlier in the week. If I hadn't stumbled into another job offer
at just the right time, I'd very likely have been fired too. It seems
Stack Overflow had decided to clean house and I got lucky. Again.

Anecdotally, I have had an easy time finding work because of
connections and opportunities that often aren't available to people
born into poor families or who grew up in other countries. There's
only been one time I did the "circle want ads in the newspaper" thing
that movies use as shorthand for job searches. That was when I was
looking for my first summer job and ended up washing dishes for [a
tennis
tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Open_(tennis)). After
the concessions closed, I could go up into the stands and watch the
final match of the night. It was a shock to move from the world of the
working-class to the world of tennis fandom.

I spent most of that summer picking up shifts at restaurants around DC
including at the Air and Space Museum, the Natural History Museum and
the National Gallery of Art. In the kitchen I was the only white
person. Meanwhile our customers were mostly white. My favorite
assignment was washing dishes at the company test kitchen. It was
entirely executives and their guests who ate there. Almost all of them
were white men. Again, I was the only white person in the kitchen.

I've volunteered in the LA County Jail. Overwhelming the inmates are
black and hispanic. Many of the men I talked to there grew up in
single-parent homes because their fathers had been put in
prison. These men have dreams of going to college, writing a book,
becoming a recording artist, starting a business and so
on. Realistically, they will be lucky to find a safe home to live
in. It's [a cycle of
incarceration](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/293213/1438) that I
wasn't born into.

I could go on about my experience that led me to believe I've have
nearly every advantage in life. Being a white man is certainly a
factor. It isn't the sole factor, of course. Everyone has their own
unique path from birth to where they are now. Some of that path is
determined by decisions like whether to go out for track or stay home
reading a book. Other parts of that path are determined by outside
forces such as whether you were born in Compton or Beverly Hills. And
some of it is just dumb luck.

From what I've observed, white men in the US tend to have a better set
of choices to pick from than other people. There are exceptions, of
course, and I won't deny that your experience is different than
mine. I somehow doubt my blog post makes a difference one way or
another when it comes to who will get what opportunities in the
future.

What I did hope my blog post would do was confront the injustice of
[excluding people in the name of
inclusion](https://web.archive.org/web/20191208001413/https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334248/an-update-to-our-community-and-an-apology). The
current calculus of privilege mostly considers attributes awarded at
birth. Since I'm a straight while man, my privilege is therefore at
the peak. Taking an honest look at my life, I happen to agree with the
result even if the method is overly crude.

As I look at the [list of people directly
hurt](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper)
by the decisions of the previous year and consider the people who made
those decisions, I see [no evidence of
accountability](https://twitter.com/jlericson/status/1230268701510733824). To
me, that's the real sign of privilege. I only paid a minimal cost
because I had connections that got me a new job even before I
quit. But imagine have the connections needed to ignore the advice of
experts, alienate thousands of people and yet keep your position of
authority over a community. That, my friend, is the epitome of
privilege in a tangible sense.

Unfortunately, Stack Overflow has engaged in social justice
theater. When management felt threatened by the strongest female voice
on the network, they found it expedient to fire her [rather than talk
with her](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/334646/1438). On the very
day [the Lavender community demonstrated
reconciliation](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731/to-reach-out-on-monica-the-lavender-community-and-the-future-of-the-stack-exc),
management (via their legal advisor) barred community managers from
discussing the ongoing confusion and growing mistrust. Management
seemed genuinely thrilled to announce [a legally binding
agreement](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio)
that prevents Monica Cellio from telling her story. A reasonable
inference is that Stack Overflow welcomes minority voices as long as
it can control them. 

The real shame of it all is that Stack Exchange benefits immensely
from members of the community who happen to be under-represented on
Stack Overflow. But since many are not developers (or "people who
code" or "technologists") the company has no use for them. I was
repeatedly told that Stack Exchange sites cost too much and that
interacting with the moderators of those sites was a waste of
time. Again, instead of uplifting minority voices, Stack Overflow
chose to suppress them.

I should hasten to say they had very good reasons for this:

* desire to create a profitable business and
* fear of being ostracized by peers. 

If not for appalling lack of judgment among the class of people who
make decisions at the company, a great deal of good could have come
from the situation. Instead, they squandered considerable trust while
simultaneously failing to achieve their stated goals.

Sorry about drifting so far from the topic. I seem to have fallen into
the trap of writing for my own benefit once again. In my defense, I
believe the only way to honestly write about privilege is to look at a
person's whole life experience. We stray into dangerous ethical waters
when we make broad generalizations about people because of attributes
outside of their control.

Thanks for reading,  
Jon
