On July 20, 2020, about 6 months after I left the company, I wrote [a
review of Stack Overflow on
Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Stack-Overflow-RVW34327310.htm).
Glassdoor's model requires people to regularly submit information to
their database in order to view contributions. This includes your own
contributions. Since I wrote about [the company's
business](/2023/05/17/so_business.html), I decided to seek out my
review and see if it held up. I don't feel like paying the
contribution tax to see my own content in the future so I decided to
save a copy. And where better than my own blog?

Of course that means it won't be anonymous anymore, but it wasn't all
that anonymous in the first place. So here's my review of Stack
Overflow from after I left the company.

> ### Pros
>
> This review isn't exactly going to be anonymous. I've written a
> bunch of blog posts to grapple with my time at Stack Overflow. When
> I was hired, I was so excited to be part of the company's
> mission. If you are reading this, there's a good chance you are
> excited too. And it really is a fantastic reason to apply. There
> just aren't a lot of places you can work where there's as large an
> opportunity to make a difference in the world as at Stack
> Exchange/Overflow. I have criticisms of how the company does remote
> work, but they have years of experience and do it better than most.
>
> I don't have any insight into other parts of the company, but Stack
Overflow has their choice of engineering talent. It's hard to imagine
I'll ever work with a better group of people. Not only are they
skilled, but everyone I worked with is personable and interesting.
>
> Stack Overflow is the sort of job that will enhance almost
everyone's resume. Everyone involved in programming and computer
technology will recognize the company and be curious about what you've
done. It's an opportunity that's difficult to pass up.
>
> ### Cons
>
> You should expect a pay cut. Since the company has no problem
attracting talent, they don't have much incentive to pay for it. I've
heard from many former coworkers (some who are alumni themselves and
others who still work there) that they accepted a reduced salary in
order to take the job. We were told the stock options and benefits
made up the difference. Obviously options are not worth anything
before the company has a liquidity event. The good news is a few years
ago the policy was changed so that options can be re-characterized and
retained when employees leave the company. The bad news is many people
were fired or left before that time. It won't matter anyway if the
company doesn't go public or get bought out before your options
expire. Options are not compensation, but rather a lottery ticket with
better than average odds of paying out an indeterminate amount.
> 
> Benefits might be generous for your circumstance, but I found my
company before and my company after Stack Overflow offered similarly
valuable benefits. Before you assume free medical will be a win, pull
out a spreadsheet and compare each item and how much it's worth to
you. I can say the sabbatical I took ended up being a difference maker
for me, but you have to stick with the company for 5 years to get
it. Before you accept an offer, do the math and negotiate for
yourself. (This isn't unique to Stack Overflow, of course.)
> 
> If you get into the interview process, make an effort to get to know
as much as you can about the people in your reporting structure. The
two things you need to be watchful for are: 1) managers who are out of
their depth and 2) managers who don't understand the product. I was
fortunate enough to work under people who met those criteria, but due
to reorganizations and other changes, I lost that protection. The job
went from a real joy to misery within months. All it takes is one weak
link in the hierarchical chain for things to fall apart.
> 
> Like many companies, Stack Overflow has a feudal management
structure. People are awarded and punished based on personal
allegiance. Effective management protects the underclass from court
politics while using influence to retain resources. Management sold
itself under the banners of "servant leadership" and "pluralism", but
these ideas were not used in practice. I think some managers believe
in these (very noble) principles, but it takes only a few people to
disrupt the balance. With no other management structure in place,
people naturally tend to help out the people they know best.
> 
> I only have rumors to go by, but it seems the free lunch at the office
came with a cost. Be extra cautious about moving to New York, London
or Munich in order to take a position. Obviously if you want to move
for other reasons, this is a good chance. Go for it! But office
politics sounded way worse in the office than at home. If nothing
else, it was useful to close the laptop and spend time with family at
any point in the workday. And then there is more unsavory gossip which
you can read right here in other reviews.
> 
> All that falls to insignificance compared to the main reason to avoid
Stack Overflow: management has discovered a way to spin gold into
straw. I don't just mean their monetization strategies, but also the
way they waste the talent given them. It manifests in so many ways:
> * People toiling on projects that are doomed from the start. 
> * Shifting priorities that keep people from doing excellent work.
> * Broken promises.
> * Naked disdain of business ethics. 
> * Lack of executive sponsorship for follow though. 
> * Reinforcement of short-term thinking and punishment of good
strategic choices. 
> * Hubris.
> * Doubling down on mistakes.
> 
> It's not hard to find examples of this, but one that stands out is
[The
Loop](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/25/introducing-the-loop-a-foundation-in-listening/). As
far as I can tell, this was a pet project of the new CEO. It was not a
bad idea in conception, but had a tight deadline that seemed
artificially set. A number of experts in various disciplines gave
feedback, but because of the deadline pressure, much of it was
ignored. The result was a flawed survey. Not only did it publicly
display embarrassing oversights, the data collected was largely
useless.
> 
> Even for people who are allowed to succeed at their specialty,
organizational dysfunction can be discouraging. Watching opportunities
go untaken and talent go fallow isn't pleasant even if your own career
is growing. If this were an uninspired job in banking, government
contracting or something, it might not be so hard to stomach as at a
company posed to make a meaningful difference.
>
> ### Advice to Management
> 
> Demonstrate truth and reconciliation. It looks like you are trying
to run out the clock before someone will buy the company and I don't
think you are going to make it. The baggage of poor management is
slowing you down and the only way to ditch it is to be open about your
mistakes and ask for forgiveness. Listen to people who aren't in your
normal social sphere. Go through the last few years of exit interviews
and fix the problems one at a time. Stop shifting blame.

There are some out-of-date items in the review. A big one is that the
options turned out to be _winning_ lottery tickets. An awful lot of
people, especially long-tenured engineers, packed their bags and moved
on to the next thing. I was fortunate enough to get a payout
sufficient to [start construction on an
ADU](https://meta.jlericson.com/t/construction-begins/158). So I guess
I was wrong about that part; management successfully ran out the
clock.

I don't know how much of the praise I heaped on the engineering team
holds. A lot of good people left when their options paid out and I
gather [engineering got the brunt of the most recent
layoffs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dalecook_opentowork-activity-7063927414552199168-c-SI/).
There are a handful of people still around who I'd love to work with
again. The Community Team is quite strong even after the layoffs. As
usual they are quietly holding everything together on the sites.

I can't imagine the benefits are anything like they were when I
left. One cost savings of company mergers comes from consolidating
benefits and HR. For the record, free medical coverage was structured in a clever
way:

1. High deductible insurance to minimize the premium Stack Overflow paid.
2. Employees pay for health care our of pocket up to the deductible.
2. Employees submit their expenses to be covered by Stack Overflow's
   health reimbursement account (HRA).
   
The clever bit is that HRAs get [special treatment in the US tax
code](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47041):

> Employer contributions to an HRA are excluded from an employeeâ€™s
gross income and wages (hence are not subject to income or payroll
taxes). Distributions from such arrangements for qualified medical
expenses are tax-free.

It works especially well with a younger workforce that might not have
medical expenses other than preventive care which is covered in any
case. Most employees will only spend a little, so it's cheaper to us
an HRA than pay the premium for a lower deductible.

Why don't other companies use this scheme? Because it shifts a lot of
the burden of medical billing from the insurance company to the
employees. After paying medical expenses, you gotta hunt down the
Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and submit it to the company managing
your HRA (usually a third-party contractor). If you don't submit your
forms correctly there's a good chance your claim will be rejected and
you'll be stuck with the expense. Fortunately I was able to sort these
things out, but it wasn't stress
free.

I mentioned [The Loop](https://stackoverflow.blog/?s=the+loop). The
most recent post was Fall of 2021, so it lasted 2 years. I don't know
how much data they ended up getting from the survey I mentioned. The
CEO does [post on the
blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/pchandrasekar/) every
quarter. Unsurprisingly, he gave up [posting on
Meta](https://stackexchange.com/users/16260110/prashanth-chandrasekar). I
don't really expect the CEO to be involved with the community, he
committed ["to continue posting on meta at least
quarterly."](/2020/02/04/misunderstanding_meta.html). He seems to be
listening to his peers (Silicon Valley CEOs) rather than his potential
customers. Hard to argue with $1.8 billion, though.

Overall, I stand by this review. If Stack Overflow is hiring and you
want to apply, be on the lookout for teams that have strong executive
sponsorship and ethical leadership. Opt for remote work unless the
office is really important to you. Don't settle for a pay cut and
compare benefits carefully.
