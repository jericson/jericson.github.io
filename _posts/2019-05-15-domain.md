I recently aquired [jlericson.com](https://jlericson.com/) to be the
new location of this blog. It's almost entirely a vanity thing as
[jericson.github.io](https://jericson.github.io/) (which still works
just fine) is plenty good enough for my purposes. Arguably it's better
since I didn't need to throw in an `l` to get a unique user name on
GitHub. 

One benefit that isn't vanity is that I can take my URLs with me
should I ever leave [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's
annoying when
[content moves and breaks links on the internet](https://github.com/jericson/jericson.github.io/commit/2017f4c7d7b9de73ef8a2dd44a0532335f3cda3e). For
less than $10 a year, I can keep that from happening. (Unless I forget
to renew the domain or purposely break links.) An
[abstraction layer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)
means that from now on that my content lives at
[jlericson.com](https://jlericson.com/).

Another benefit of the domain abstraction layer is that I can switch
to an email that will follow me around too. I'm using Porkbun as my
registrar, which includes
[email forwarding](https://porkbun.com/products/email_forwarding). (By
the way, if you follow [this link](porkbun.com/jericson) and register
a domain, I get a small commission. Unless the page still
[404s](https://porkbun.com/404) in which case you can enjoy a tiny
choose-your-own adventure.) If I ever move away from Gmail or just
want to set up my own email server, I won't have to contact everyone I
know. (Or rather, I'll only need to do that _one more time_ since I'm
not planning on telling everyone to use my new address given my old
one still works.) And I can set up email forwarding for other people
in my family, if they want it.

Gallons of digital ink are regularly spilt on selecting a perfect domain. To distill what I've read, domains should be:

1. short and
2. memorable

Arguably #1 is implied by #2. Although I do like the idea of a
[.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.net) or
[.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.org) domain,
[.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com) is the default
[top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) and
has an edge when it comes to people remembering it. The tradition of
internet start-ups is to take a short word and remove a silent `e` to
make it even shorter: Flickr, Tumblr, Grindr and Scribd. We've
probably reached
[Peak Weirdness](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/startup-names-may-have-passed-peak-weirdness/)
so those names are unfashionable.

Since the domain is about hosting _my_ content, I wanted something
related to my name. Someone already uses
[jonericson.com](http://jonericson.com/) and the
[Ericson Manufacturing Company](https://www.ericson.com/company/history/)
has my last name. Next I thought jericson would be good, because it
was my first computer username and is pretty easy to derive from the
name I usually go by. But whoever owns it right now wants almost
$3,000 for it. So just like I did for my Yahoo username in the 90s, I
decided to add
[my middle initial](http://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis/).

To reiterate: **getting a personal domain is mostly an exercise in
vanity**. While there is some value in having a permanent address on
the internet, it's not worth buying a cool domain for thousands of
dollars. A lot of perfectly serviceable domains are there for the
taking even in the `.com`
TLD. [In all things, moderation.](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/586/73)
