When I first got Munchkin, I was excited to dip my toes into tabletop
RPGs. I'd played computerized RPGs over the years, but physical D&D
seemed too much to start playing with my family and friends. As you
might expect, our first game was disappointing.

Munchkin, to borrow a video-game phrase, is a card game with RPG
elements. The goal of the game, isn't to get through the dungeon, but
to level up to 10 before anyone else does. Role-playing is a means to
that end and no story could hold it together. At any point characters
might change race or class, if they have the right cards and see a way
to gain an advantage. That's hard to explain in game fiction, so this
game just doesn't bother.

We finished that first game and I
figured I didn't enjoy it because I had misunderstood the concept of
the game. (This was many years ago when people would buy games based
on the box art. I certainly didn't read internet reviews at that
time.)  We didn't play again for a while and the box ended up on a
rarely visited closet shelf. Recently we moved and rediscovered
Munchkin.

With clear eyes about what we were getting into, we decided to play
again. It ... didn't go well. It was kinda fun for the first
half-hour, but it just took so long for someone to win we were glad it
was over.

Maybe you've played <a
href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/258/fluxx" >Fluxx</a>? It's
a game where the rules are printed on the cards themselves, so players
can constantly change the objectives. It means a player can be close
to winning when, out of the blue, someone else moves the goalposts
wiping out the leader's advantage. Alternatively, the new rules might
award the win to someone who wasn't close a moment before. On occasion
players get just the right set of cards to win in a very clever
way. It good for 20 minutes or so to kick off a game
night.

But every now and then a game drags on as people
can't seem to have the right combination of cards. Between a bad run
of cards and aggressive blocking of other players, nothing goes as
planned. The fun starts to drain away. Instead of playing something
more engaging, everyone keeps working on what was supposed to be
filler. The smart thing to do is declare a draw and put the cards
away.

Munchkin is like that except there's never a quick and
clever game. You always start with ill-equipped level 1 characters who
regularly find themselves running away from much higher-level
monsters. As characters gain levels and equipment, they have an easier
time, but the incentive to cooperate dissipates too. Finally someone
gets close to winning and everyone else tries to stop that from
happening.

Reading that paragraph again, it strikes me that
this could be a very enjoyable trajectory. It's a three-act structure
upon which an excellent story could be told. But Munchkin isn't
interested in story telling. It doesn't want my human warrior to
betray your halfling thief. It wants players to "stab your
buddy". It's less a game and more a machine for pranking each
other.

For people who jell with that sort of game, there's
nothing else quite like it. Which is why there are endless themed
expansions, I suppose. (Fluxx too has many themed expansions for the
same reason.) It's probably especially suited for a group of friends
who want an excuse to spend time together and laugh at (fake)
indignities they cause each other to suffer. I can respect
that.

My copy seems destined gather dust on the shelf once
again. Even if the concept of the game interested me, I don't think
it's particularly well implemented. It's surprisingly fiddly and
shockingly random. So much depends on getting a monster card you can
defeat (ideally without help). So much depends on understanding
arbitrary-seeming rules such as Big vs. Small items. There's a rule
for selling items to gain a level that seems pretty important which we
missed altogether because the rule is buried in the Items section
rather than having it's own section under Treasures. But maybe this is
in keeping with the RPG munchkin theme?
