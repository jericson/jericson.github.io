Last year, [I wrote I was joining College
Confidential](/2020/01/17/leaving_stack.html). Well, it seems I'm once
again leaving a job I love. My last day at CC is March 19. This is the
first time, however, I've left a job without knowing what I'll do
next. Unfairly perhaps, [things tend to work out for
me](/2020/07/08/reader_mail.html). It doesn't hurt that I'm married to
a talented and dedicated nurse who can support our family by taking on
more shifts while I'm job hunting. In addition, I'm confident someone
will be able to appreciate and afford my esoteric abilities.

When I left Stack Exchange, I worried I excelled at the job only due
to deeply understanding the sort of people who are drawn to Q&A
sites. (Because I was one!) How could I be sure that I'd be able to
manage a forum community largely populated by people deeply interested
in college admissions? To preview the end of the story, [I got this
encouraging reply to a post announcing new
rules](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602/16?u=ccadmin_jon)
on College Confidential:

Now a lot of other people played a role in turning around the
perception that the company wasn't interested in improving the
community experience. It took well over a year of focused effort from
developers, designers, product managers and community managers to get
this result. Business development, marketing and my own managers
showed an unusual degree of sensitivity to the community. It would be
false modesty, however, if I didn't admit to playing a central role in
guiding toward this outcome.

My work began months before I was formally hired when an old friend
asked me to evaluate the community that his organization had just
inherited. In October, 2019, I created an account and [posted a
reply](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/8-grammar-errors-that-make-admission-officers-cringe/2069930/16?u=ccadmin_jon)
to get an idea of how the community worked. I poked around various
parts of the site and made some notes. Here's a sample:

* Lots of acronyms; no glossary?
* I not sure what the goal of the forums are.
* Banned users at the top of the “Most Active this Month” report. 
  * Activity isn’t probably what you want to optimize for anyway.
* Is there a way to format posts? (Guess: BBCode)
* Curious if there are patterns to joining, becoming engaged and
  disengaging. Seems like students and parents might not have any
  reason to stay once college is over. Maybe not even once the
  application process has ended.

For there I listed a few recommended next steps to begin solving the
many problems I observed. The list included:

* Simplify the rules.
* Create a theory of moderation.
* Interview the CM, moderators and key community members to understand
  their needs.
* Conduct 1-on-1 usability tests with new and existing users.
* Set up an A/B test framework.
* Start a community-curated FAQ.
* Investigate moving to Discourse.

At this point I wasn't planning to leave Stack Overflow. The new
owners of CC were considering bringing me on as a part-time consultant
and I figured I'd keep my day job. A month later I'd decided to leave
my job and the new plan was to bring me on as a Community Manager
fulltime. That list of recommendations became my personal goals for
the community.

At Stack Exchange I never had a clear a picture of how I was
doing. For one thing, I was part of a larger community team and worked
with a wide variety of product managers. For another, I could rarely
focus on just one community of the dozens I was directly responsible
for. Perhaps most critically, however, I was working from the base of
a well-developed set of community norms. Was I getting complimented on
my work because I'm an eloquent writer or because I'm successfully
managing the community?[^2]

College Confidential had been neglected and mismanaged for half a
decade, as the user I quoted noted. The founders [sold CC to Hobsons
in
2008](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/big-cc-news-college-confidential-joins-hobsons/507367). The
new company seemed a good steward for the community for several
years. It's main contribution was building a school search that, from
everything I've heard, was exceptional. A few years later, [CC was
transferred from one organization to
another](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/our-fresh-new-look-is-here/2058932/1174?u=ccadmin_jon). Nobody
seemed to have an idea about what to do with the community. By the
time I was brought on, the only real continuity was a community
manager hired by Hobsons.

My first area of concern was whether the other CM, Sorin, should stay
on. Immediately after starting the job, I set up weekly 1-on-1
meetings with him. Thankfully I discovered Sorin is a skilled
community manager who had been hampered by shifting priorities and
poor decisions from his superiors. Hobsons trusted him to manage the
community, but subsequent owners made a series of technological,
marketing and even community decisions that I find
baffling. Fortunately, they didn't jettison the CM who was a lifeline
for the community.

Next I met the volunteer moderators. I used to say that Stack Exchange
was blessed with the internet's best moderators. I still believe that,
but I'm beginning to suspect that people who willingly step up to
moderate online communities are exceptional people as a rule. I don't
agree with every decision the CC mods make, but they care about the
community and strive constantly to keep it healthy.

Once I had settled in, I asked Sorin to [introduce me to the
community](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-jon-our-new-community-product-operations-manager/2083010?u=ccadmin_jon). Not
every CM works this way, but I prefer to be personally engaged:

> My goal with the you, the CC community, is to listen to your
> frustrations with the site and address those needs as I’m able. That
> might not mean doing things the way you are most comfortable
> with. But I will do my best to make sure your viewpoint is heard.

It's a form of transparency[^3] that opened up the inner workings of
CC's new owners to the community. Not long afterwards, my promise was
put to the test when I introduced [a new tagging
system](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/discussions-may-now-be-tagged/2086846/29?u=ccadmin_jon):

> Unfortunately, we’re stuck with some of the glitches until we can

The plans I mentioned would eventually lead to us moving the community
forums over to [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), but that's
jumping forward in the story. Online communities exist on a software
platform the same way physical communities exist in a particular
space. Cities inform their citizens of new construction projects and
community managers discuss upcoming developer projects too. It's
important because both types of communities vote with their feet.

I began identifying leaders within the community. Moderators are
obvious choices, but there are often individuals who influence the
community without any formal title. To get a better idea of what the
community needed, I set up calls with a handful of community
leaders. Mostly I listened. As I gathered more information, I
started picking up on patterns:

* Nobody cared for the recent site redesign.
* The confidential nature of the site was important. Many users worked
  in the college admissions field and didn't want their affiliations
  publicly known.
* Longtime members had forged close friendships with other members and
  preferred using private messages to interact with each other.
* The core community cared about students, but were jaded by wave
  after wave of ambitious new users eager to get an advantage in
  applying to elite schools.
  
Students (and their parents) are, of course, the future of
CC. Weirdly, there has long been [an active category for
parents](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/parents-forum/parent-cafe/632)
but no dedicated space for students. We corrected that problem by
creating the [Student
Lounge](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/student-lounge/756). The
corollary to [The Field of Dreams
fallacy](https://medium.com/colindarretta/the-field-of-dreams-fallacy-a-warning-to-aspiring-entrepreneurs-e682be46c672)
is "If you don't build it, they will go elsewhere." Cultivating the
student experience without sacrificing what makes the site attractive
to parents isn't an easy task. To look ahead in my story, we
introduced [dedicated student groups just this
year](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-student-groups/3499294)
which have helped grow a small core of student leaders.

It's no secret that business interests often come in conflict with the
preferences of online communities. There were a lot of
behind-the-scenes discussions about how to grow the business in a
community-friendly way. I think all community managers know the
struggle. Thankfully, the company that currently owns CC knows it
depends on a healthy community in order to thrive. Still an effective
CM must advocate for the community internally. Unless it is unethical
or illegal, a community manger has a responsibility to effectively
communicate whatever decision is made back to the community.

A decision I was eager to communicate with the community was our plan
to move to a new platform. It's one of the most disruptive things that
can happen to a community and so it's incredibly risky. I worked with
management to explore various options such as reverting to a previous
version of the site, taking over hosting from our hosting company on
the same platform or moving to other forum platforms. But over and
over we kept coming back to Discourse as the right answer.[^4]

Once the decision was made last summer, I began planning with a
[change
manager](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/change-management-job-description)[^5]
at the company to prepare the community. In a way we benefited from
how miserable the experience was before the change. Still, you never
know how people will adjust to the worst conditions.

[![PHP coders adjusting to painful Stack Overflow shocks in
2038.](https://i.redd.it/v53przfht6n01.png)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8667lt/stackoverflow_has_become_sentient/)

As soon as we could invite users to try it out, we started our alpha
test. We invited various community leaders to preview the site from
August through September. Their feedback helped us fix many issues and
gave us advocates for the change. In October, we started our [beta
test](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/call-for-beta-testers/2104299)
by inviting any member of the community who wanted to get a sneak peak
to do some [usability tests](/2016/06/30/usability_tests.html). I met
with students and parents. Some had experienced the existing site and
others had not. By the end of October, we were ready for our [Charlie
test](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/please-test-the-future-of-cc-forums/2106274). Anyone
who had an account on the production site could log into the new site
to try it out.

Now this didn't go perfectly smoothly. Some users [worried the change
was happening too quickly and without their
input](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/why-we-are-changing-platforms-and-why-now/2107446). We
also had a frustrating glitch where [a number would be randomly added
to the end of a user's
name](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/please-help-us-test-a-fix-for-the-added-1-issue/2107899). The
problem [stumped our
developers](https://meta.discourse.org/t/usernames-getting-modified-numeral-1-being-added/169431). It
turned out we had a setting that allowed our SSO service to override
the username on Discourse. Somehow that got interpreted as creating a
new user. But since the username was already in the system, the
username would be changed to one that didn't conflict. Every time a
user logged in they'd toggle the number on and off.

Finally we [had a launch
date](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/new-cc-forums-launch-date-set-november-23/2108198). After
changing to the new system, the real work began. Sorin and I worked
with the rest of the team to answer dozens, maybe hundreds, of user
questions. Discourse modernizes the forum experience, but it's not
intuitive to everyone. Even this week there have been questions about
how features of Discourse work.

There's so much I want to talk about that happened last year. I still
haven't talked about the [COVID
megethreads](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/pandemic-megathreads-and-moderation/2092274)
or [the rules that made no sense to
anyone](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602). And
there are innumerable interactions that add up to a mutual
understanding between a community manager and a community. As I wrap
up my time at CC, I reflect on how much of myself I put into the work,
how much I will treasure the past year and how I'm looking forward to
whatever God puts before me.

Footnotes:

[^1]: He means "pre-Discourse", but I like this phrasing too. ;-) I'll
    explain the transition to Discourse further into this post.

[^2]: In a very real sense, these aren't so different really. The job
    something like 95% communication and 5% knowing what works.

[^3]: A frequently misunderstood concept, by the way. For more
    details, I recommend a pair of essays from my former collegues
    [Meg
    Risdal](https://mrisdal.github.io/blog/posts/transparency-in-online-communities/)
    and
    [Shog9](https://gist.github.com/Shog9/7d08c54f5220f51de3b868907320391e).

[^4]: I have _a lot_ to say on this topic, but I do want to publish
    this post sometime before my time at CC ends.
    
[^5]: Confusingly, this job is _also_ abbreviated as CM. I've also got
    a lot to say about the overlap of these two roles.
