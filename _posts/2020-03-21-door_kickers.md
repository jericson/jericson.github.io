 I started playing Plague Inc: Evolved again after COVID-19 arrived in my city. The conceit is you are a pathogen intent on wiping out humanity. So, it's on the morbid side, which may or may not be what you want in the middle of a pandemic. (It was for me, but I'm not necessarily typical.) I've wiped out humanity as a bacteria, a virus and a fungus. There are many other variations, including horror and a "fake news" scenarios, created by the developer. Included is a scenario creator which allows anyone with the game to create and publish their own versions. Not surprisingly, there are several COVID-19/coronavirus scenarios to play with.
 

 

 There are two different ways to think about Plague Inc.: as a game and as a simulation. The game play mechanics are simple: collect DNA points and spend them to evolve your pathogen. Evolutions can occur in transmission, symptoms and abilities. The basic strategy is to start increasing transmission until everyone is infected and then start increasing symptoms until everyone dies. Abilities can be added to slow research into a cure or help your pathogen survive various environments. Most of the game can be played by waiting, so there's also a bubble popping mechanic that provides more DNA points randomly or when a new country is infected. So it starts to feel like a clicker game with end-states. The various pathogen differences feel more like window dressing than real game play variations. So the game isn't really all that good.
 

 

 As a simulation, it's not terribly deep. Maybe that's not fair. Maybe there's depth that isn't visible to the player. As far as I can tell, there are a handful of variables the evolutions control and those determine how the pathogen is transmitted, what symptoms patients might come down with, how deadly the disease is and how quickly a cure can be found. It clearly tracks ports and boarder which can be closed down. And every country/region has it's own set of variables. So it has a vernier of simulation.
 

 

 Unfortunately, the simulation doesn't track well with how pandemics are actually modeled. Take for instance
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  this article about COVID-19
 </a>
 <span class="bb_link_host">
  [medium.com]
</details><br/>
 . It uses more complex model that includes transmission rates, incubation period, infectious days, fatality rates, etc. It also considers the possibility of collateral damage that occurs when the health system is overtaxed. Plague Inc. doesn't consider how prepared a country would be to implement strict quarantine procedures or whether it might be unprepared to test for the disease. As it turns out, these factors play a large part in determining how well a country does in a pandemic.
 

 

 But the larger problem is that the game aspect of Plague Inc. interferes with the simulation aspect. A pandemic might conceivably destroy civilization, but it won't have the advantage of being controlled by an intelligence that can adjust the lethality of the pathogen. The mutations that might occur will not be the simple toggles made necessary to play the game nor can they be reverted as a part of a larger strategy.
 

 

 Still, the two parts together are morbidly fascinating. The "what if" aspect of the game is quite strong even if the game play and simulation are weak. I've certainly been captivated by it the times I've played. But there's never quite been enough to propel to the next pathogen I unlock. Instead, I just feel like uninstalling the game and contemplating the fleetingness of life after I've masterminded the death of humanity.


 During the 90s, Magic: The Gathering set off a craze of collectable card games. These required players to build a deck of cards to compete with each other. For people willing to invest the time and money to play, these games were incredibly engaging. Maybe the most enjoyable way to play was the card draft in which players would open new packs of cards and select cards one by one hoping to create an effective deck. Later games like Dominion, Ascension and Star Realms (to name games I played) dispensed with the "collectable" aspect of the game by releasing complete sets of cards and building the drafting system into the core of the game. The result is a far more approachable system that can be introduced to new players.
 

 

 Slay the Spire takes that basic deck builder game and turns it into a finely tuned solo game. In theory this could be a physical game, but there's a lot going on just under the surface that makes it best suited for a computer. For instance, the enemies follow simple rules for what they do each turn, but there's a definite progression of challenge to your deck's increasing strength. Also you start collecting relics that change the basic rules of the game. Finally, there are a wide variety of status effects, potions and powers that need to be accounted for. Doing it all on a table top would be tedious and slow, but the computer makes this stuff fast.
 

 

 Fast play is important too. After a few games you get to know the rhythms of combat. When to block and when to attack are the basic choices, but later you need to use your deck efficiently. Playing cards shouldn't take very long and most enemies can be defeated in a few minutes. The real challenge of the game is picking one (or zero!) cards from a draw of three at the end of every combat. In other words, building your deck.
 

 

 Each game will work out a bit differently based on early draws and your choice of cards. Collecting block cards might lead you down a path of defense and waiting for chances to strike. (Ideally getting a Shield Strike card.) Collecting cards that focus on other abilities results in other types of play. The real joy of the game is discovering deck strategies that combine cards in imaginative ways. To be clear, the game design is the source of the strategies. Players merely discover them. But when you do, it feels as if you've made a scientific breakthrough.
 

 

 There are now four different characters to play and each has a very different set of mechanics build into their card sets. Finding the strategies of one won't help reveal the strategies of the other characters. The enemies you face along the way seem to be the same for each character, but they get increasingly challenging and interesting. Once you play through to the end, you'll have a good idea of what you need to be prepared for in the next run. Unlike so many other games, this one doesn't seem to wear out once you've completed a run. There are always more things to unlock and discover.
 

 

 I'm not sure if it's true, but it very much feels as if the game should always be beaten if the player plays well. There's a quirk where you can go back to the start of a combat by quitting the game before the final blow. I've used that feature to replay combats that I've lost decisively with the same order of cards and enemy moves. Usually the second time results in a win for me as I avoid mistakes. Still, I normally just take the lose because I can see I picked cards poorly. I never feel the game is unfair; I just feel like I made mistakes I could have avoided. A good deal of this comes from being able to see enemy actions before they are made and having a somewhat predictable enemy progression.
 

 

 The game also includes a bunch of cards and relics to unlock, a daily challenge mode and plenty of statistics to chew on. It rewards replay without a whiff of grinding. And it can be played in short play sessions or while listening to something else. It's an excellent blend of simplicity and depth.


 Almost There naturally gets compared to Super Meat Boy. It is a punishingly challenging platformer that requires many attempts and nearly perfect execution to complete the short levels. There are only two control verbs: horizontal control and jump. Every other mechanic arises from the environment. For instance, long platforms allow the player to gain enough momentum to make longer jumps and vertical surfaces enable wall jumps. The levels introduce new mechanics in smart ways so you never feel overwhelmed or stuck. Instead, your focus can stay on planning your movement and perfecting your actions.
 

 

 Still, this game lacks a lot of Super Meat Boy's character. I mean this in a literal sense as you control a cube in a sterile environment. Sometimes elaborate themes and story can be distracting, you know? Perhaps a better comparison is 140, another platformer featuring a square. (Though, that box turns into a circle when rolling and a triangle in the air.) The one bit of character Almost There's box has is a red line, which seems to be a bit of ribbon according to the cover art. It serves a useful purpose of streaming behind to show where you've travelled.
 

 

 Despite being demanding, it is possible to make progress through the levels if you take your time and plan your route. I suspect the square shape aids platforming by making platform edges obvious. Like Super Meat Boy, the levels are short and it's easy enough to try again. Unlike SMB, you don't restart the level immediately after failing. Instead, you have to press a button. I think this is intended as an aid to speedrunning so that you can prepare to start the run immediately. Completing levels under certain time thresholds earn extra stars. (I think the stars unlock new words, but that's unclear.) In my opinion, it would be better to just boot the player back into the level without a button press. That encourages the player to do focused practice that can help them learn to be better at the game. Also, and this mostly fun, I miss Super Meat Boy's replay feature which shows all the ways you failed before beating a level.
 

 

 Many of the mechanics (especially the spinning buzz saws) harken back to Super Meat Boy. Some of the challenges seem a bit closer to plagiarism than homage. If you are going to copy, take from the best, I suppose. Still, there are plenty of unique (as far as I know) ideas here. More importantly, Almost There captures the tension and release cycle that makes for the best platforming experience. You are in complete control of that little box whether using the keyboard or controller, so yours is the responsibility of failure and so is the glory of success.


 I got this game in a bundle a few years ago and assumed it was some sort of turn-based wargame. Going through the main campaign was pretty easy until I hit a wall on about the 8th or 9th level (of 19). It seemed like a poorly designed game with a very uneven difficulty curve. So I uninstalled it and forgot it existed. Recently, I noticed there was a sale on Zachtronics games. Since I enjoyed the SpaceChem demo and was interested in programming-type games, I thought I'd see if anything caught my eye. Imagine my surprise when I noticed I already owned one of their games: Ironclad Tactics. Knowing the developer and their style of game, I thought I'd give it another shot.
 

 

 In truth, this is a deck-building puzzle game with steampunk story set in the Civil War-era United States. You can't necessarily play the game in a straightforward way. The strategy comes from selecting cards before each battle starts. There is tactics within each stage to pull off your chosen strategy, but winning is mostly about getting the right cards. So doing well means collecting the right cards and knowing how to use them. All the stages can (and should) be replayed to get new cards if you perform certain feats, such as using a particular set of cards. Many cards can be upgraded by meeting certain conditions, such as using them to attack a certain number of enemies or get a number of victory points.
 

 

 The trick is it's hard to know how to pick cards until you play the stage and fail. You might get lucky the first time by picking cards that happen to work well, but that's the exception. It might help to look at the optional goals, but winning those often depends on cards that you aren't guaranteed to have yet. Trial and error don't exactly work the best with a narrative game. Neither does replaying the mission you just beat to beat it a different way. This might be why the story doesn't stick with me at all.
 

 

 On the other hand, building an effective deck and using it well can be a lot of fun. The true gameplay loop includes quitting a mission halfway when you realize a card isn't working or you need another card added in. Often a card seems pointless when you first get it, but starts looking useful when you try later stages or combine them with newly unlocked cards. Some levels have puzzles that illustrate the use of certain cards. (The puzzles aren't all that hard, but they are reasonably enjoyable and quick.)
 

 

 Putting together decks is somewhat simplified by not allowing more than 2 factions. Since each faction has distinct characteristics, you can plan decks that combine strengths. The levels have an interesting variety of obstacles and a few have unique objectives which give more reason to explore various deck combinations. Each deck is also given appropriately themed names such as "The Monroe Engagement" and "Remarkable Bastion". (I don't know if there is any particular method to these names or if they are just random.)
 

 

 Considering there is a New Game Plus mode and the expansions are now bundled with the base game, there's plenty of content and replayability here. My sessions tend to be short since they do get puzzly and my brain gets tired after I complete a challenge. I do enjoy returning to the game after a break, however. I might complain a bit about the luck required sometimes (often when a needed card doesn't show up), but that's part of the challenge of building an effective deck. Most likely the solution is to swap out whatever cards aren't helping.
 

 

 In summary: an enjoyable game if you know what you are getting yourself into.


 After an hour and a half, I think it's safe to say this is a funny game. It starts by putting your character on top of an airplane with an RPG to shoot out air defense systems like some sort of insane barnstorming terrorist. But the line that got me was when I accidentally baled out of a car, watched it shoot off a cliff and the protagonist said, "A perfect parking spot!" The gameplay mechanics seem ripe for goofy fun. I enjoyed shooting a cable at a billboard I was tasked to destroy and attaching the other end of the cable to a truck. It's almost like Spiderman meets American Graffiti.
 

 

 I'm less certain the story or the quest lines will keep my interest for long. Funny doesn't always mean fun. Also, I get the impression some of the early scenarios are supposed to be more funny than they actually are for me. Still, worth picking up in a sale or whatnot.


 UBERMOSH is a simple and very difficult arcade game similar to Robotron: 2084. As a smooth twin-skick shooter, it plays equally well with a mouse and keyboard or gamepad. (I usually find a mouse better for precision aiming and the gamepad for twitchy movement. I think the gamepad is slightly better for this game.) Enemies (technically competitors) stream in from the edges of the playfield attempting to kill you. Fortunately, you are armed with a gun and a sword. The sword is particularly useful as it serves both close combat and deflecting bullets. The game offers several player classes, including an arguably overpowered sword-only Kensai which can use no guns, but gets 6 lives. Mastering the sword is the key to the game, so it's a good class to start with.
 

 

 You will die—constantly. Winning isn't possible, but there are steam achievements and high scores. (I gather a round ends after 90 seconds, which could be considered a win state if you make it.) It's really a classic arcade style designed to eat quarters. Fortunately, restarting is free (and quick). The idea is to keep learning from mistakes and improving your skill. It can feel a little bit unfair since the viewport is small compared to field of play. Enemies and projectiles come from all directions, but it would be nice to see more so that you can plan your moves. Still, most hits can be avoided with skill.
 

 

 Also, quite listenable music.


 On my Mac, this game gets stuck on a black screen at launch. I've seen a workaround for Linux, but it didn't work immediately for me. So I gave up trying to fix it. In any case, there's no reason the developer shouldn't patch the game since it's advertised for Mac.
 

 

 If this gets fixed (or if I end up playing on WIndows), I'll update this review.


 Effective humor depends on timing. When you tell a good joke, the punchline arrives unexpectedly. Therefore, it's a bit hard to make jokes in games where the player's decisions change the flow of the setup. So interactive fiction could be a good way to deliver kitchen appliance double entendre. Unfortunately, this particular game is too wordy by half and the jokes get old before they are wrapped up. Then there's a really dumbed-down game vaguely reminiscent of Burgertime. Some of the jokes (the toaster and knife) are kinda clever, but there too many empty words so the jokes get old.
 

 

 I decided to get all the achievements, which wasn't a good use of time. (I had a movie running on another screen since the game is mindless.) Unfortunately, the spacebar skips the dialog and also selects an option. So you gotta be a bit careful if you don't want just pick the default option. There's only one save, so you gotta do some planning to get each ending. It's the closest you get gameplay, so that's something.
 

 

 I was a bit worried the game would go pornographic. The text is super suggestive and there's a final image with the male protagonist, er, player character with a bare chest for each ending. If the writer had just gotten out of the way of the jokes, I probably would recommend the experience for people who like off-the-wall humor of a sexual nature. That was not to be.


 D-Day requires two units that hadn't previously been introduced to the
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28557252-Fish-and-Loaves/list/36127/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Tank Battle series
 </a>
 : paratroopers and landing craft. Both come with quirks that make them a bit gamey.
 

 

 Many missions use landing craft that come in two varieties: regular and gigantic. In order to land heavy equipment, such as tanks, on the beach, the Allies used LCT (Landing Craft, Tank). In the game, these occupy 7(!?!) hexes and hold up to three units. Alternatively, LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel AKA Higgins boats) occupy one hex and hold two units. The trick is maneuvering LCTs so that armor can provide cover for infantry. It can also be a struggle to unload engineers early so they can clear mines. Landing craft blocking the next wave of units seems like an authentic problem the Allies faced. Somewhat less authentic is mortars and artillery raining shells on the enemy while still on the landing craft. The main advantage is they aren't clogging the beaches.
 

 

 Paratroopers work like off-map artillery except a new unit materializes in an empty hex. This can be very convenient to capture strategic and control points. The landing zone must be within the visible area of the map and not on a building or an enemy unit. Otherwise, you have complete freedom and the drop will go exactly as you order. While that's handy, it's hard to connect the mechanism with the historical reality. Real airborne drops were chaotic and disorganized. Paratroopers often found themselves in unknown territory far from their objectives. For the sake of the game, I suppose deterministic drops are best. But I wish there were some way to simulate the confusion of the actual invasion.
 

 

 Speaking of historical simulation, the maps of the beaches were designed to reflect the actual battlefields including German pillboxes, obstructions and fortifications. Other missions are more thematic than modeled directly after Normandy events. Frankly, the historical missions tend to be tedious. It's just a lot of maneuvering and slow chipping away at German fortifications. I suppose that's what it was really like. One way the level designers enlivened these missions is by sub-goals. If the Allies capture certain points, they can stop German artillery.
 

 

 Overall, this is a worthy addition to the Tank Battle series with novel features.


 I've been reviewing the
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28557252-Fish-and-Loaves/list/36127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Tank Battle series
 </a>
 and it's getting hard to differentiate the games now. East Front might be "the one with the odd campaign interface". Instead of showing the flags of your army and the opposition, this installment gives you a choice of dates from 1941 to 1945 and "Core". Then you see a cryptic set of campaigns with names like "Attack!", "Momentum" and "Collapse". Finally, you can work through a series of missions with slightly less mundane names ("January Thunder", for instance). I believe all of these missions involve just German and Russian forces, so you really need to be interested in their combat equipment.
 

 

 If you are the sort who cares about each variation of the Panzer III (and II and IV, etc.), this is the game for you. According to the feature list, there's even a chance to deploy flamethrower tanks. Unfortunately, I have no idea which missions might include them since the campaign menu is so convoluted. Other than the model differences, it can be hard to tell the difference between one tank variation and the next. Instead of changing the way you use units, the variations mostly seem distinct only in having slightly different stats.
 

 

 Poking at the missions randomly, I did find one new mechanic that added to the experience. Some missions give an option to destroy AA guns in order to grant the player with air support. In theory, that would give players a choice in how they tackle the battle. Instead of racing to the final control point, it might be better to divert a few units to accomplish the optional objective and call in more firepower. However, the one mission I found with this feature didn't use it well. Since there was a bridge to the final objective, there was a traffic jam. So it didn't cost anything to move a few units out of line and take care of the AA.
 

 

 I still recommend this game, but not as strongly as
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/540150/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Tank Battle: Blitzkrieg
 </a>
 and others in the series.


 A free and quick game that's worth a few minutes playing. You're better off playing than reading this review.

 I will note that the achievement does not seem to work on a Mac, if you care about such things.


 Tank Battle: 1945 adds to the
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/recommended/396320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  base game
 </a>
 . The big changes I noticed are new units (flamethrowers, airborne and engineers), unit stacking for some types (notably mortars) and road reinforcements that allow more units to arrive at once in the same hex. These are welcome improvements, but there are no new nations and the missions seem to work the same as in
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/recommended/540150/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Blitzkrieg
 </a>
 .
 

 

 I didn't enjoy the sampling of missions I've played as much as the previous game. They tend to be much larger, which involves moving a lot of units. Missions also tend to be straightforward attacking or defending control points. As a result, they create more busywork and fewer impactful decisions. Still entertaining, but not as excellent as previous iterations.


 The
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/recommended/396320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Tank Battle series
 </a>
 heads back to 1939 and the shocking German attacks on Poland followed by the 1940 conquest of France by German and Italian forces. As a result, this edition contains the widest variety of armies and missions so far. Armament has also been reverted to early war effectiveness. But these are relatively unimportant compared to the new missions.
 

 

 None of the missions really simulate historical situations, but they do give a feel for them. For instance, I finished the Polish missions which are all defensive in nature. Offensive missions in wargames don't require much more than challenging goals to be enjoyable. But when the roles are reversed, something more tends to be required. Facing the German Blitzkrieg, Tank Battles has solved the problem with a series of dynamic victory conditions that can be quite satisfying to accomplish.
 

 

 One mission requires the Polish army to defend a crossroads until German reinforcements make the position hopeless. At that point, the goal changes to moving a captain (really just a named Polish infantry unit) to a victory point on the other side of a river. As you might notice, these are more suggestive than historical. The first time I attempted the mission, I used the special unit to defend the first victory point and lost it well before making the escape. For the second try, I started maneuvering the captain toward the goal immediately. Unfortunately, it stumbled upon enemy infantry in the forest and was reduced in strength before slipping across the river. Although my army was reduced to a single hit point of the special unit, I was able to win victory by reaching the goal. Each turn was touch and go as the Germans took shots at my hapless captain.
 

 

 The more I play Tank Battle games, the more I admire their craft at mission design. It's not the most glamorous thing in the world, but short, challenging and balanced wargames are a pleasure to experience.


 Tank Battle: North Africa is nearly the same game as Tank Battle: 1944. For details on the rather straightforward wargame system, see
 <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/recommended/396320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  my review of the previous game
 </a>
 . Obviously the big difference is the desert setting and the necessary addition of British units. The missions also seem to have more variations. For instance, instead of simply taking a victory point, you might be expected to take it and defend it for 10 more turns. I haven't come close to completing all the missions in both games, so I don't know for sure, but these missions seem harder and more interesting.
 

 

 As with TB:1944, the scenarios are not in any way historical. Instead these are encounters between two evenly matched armies on carefully crafted terrain. For a beer and pretzels game, the Tank Battle series does require thought and planning to play well. This is a tribute to the the map design and the AI.
 

 

 Given the choice between this release and the previous title, I'd recommend North Africa as a more varied and engaging experience.


 What we have here is an old-fashioned, IGOUGO, hex and counter, terrain modifier, odds-based wargame. While it was originally built for iOS devices, it feels like it could have been taken from a 1970s-era Avalon Hill catalog. The very few concessions to modern sensibilities (and the computer) include fog of war and diceless random number generation. It's a no-frills game that somehow kept me engaged for an evening without noticing the time fly by.
 

 

 Most of the eight campaigns have a dozen missions with (as far as I can tell) unique maps. It's pretty clear the maps are assembled from tiles with different terrain features. Even so, they look attractive and there are enough variations in tree tiles to prevent visual boredom. The units, especially tanks, are nicely modeled. As they wait to be moved, infantry looks around and tank turrets rotate from time to time. When you move them, tanks leave tread-marks that fade after a few seconds. It might be a simple game, but its developers put a lot of effort into the little details that can make a big difference.
 

 

 A few holdovers from the mobile game exist. For instance, the menus are giant boxes with indistinct lettering. It's entirely playable with just the mouse, which has some advantages. One mode is hotseat multiplayer. Unfortunately, there's no screen between the end of one player's turn and the start of the next, so you get a quick look at the opponent's order of battle. On a smaller device, I suspect this is mitigated by handing over your phone while pressing the end of turn button. I don't intend to play multiplayer in any case, but it's awkward if you are thinking about it.
 

 

 As befits the title, the battles involve German and American hardware from 1944. Since German tanks were more capable during that timeframe, the default game levels their abilities a bit to make more even matches. There's also an optional "Historical Mode" that restores the disparity and makes American missions harder. Another difficulty setting controls the behavior of the AI to make it less reckless. Reinforcements come at a fixed schedule and as you take victory points. Unfortunately, no units are carried over to the next mission so the only advantage to playing well is whether you get one, two or three medals.
 

 

 Campaign progression is simple: complete a mission to unlock the next one. Battles don't seem particularly tied to real conflicts. The descriptions tend to be functional: take this victory point, reinforcements on turn 8, watch out for German Tiger tanks!, and so on. It's a little disappointing given the existence of the Panzer General series and the modernized Panzer Corps. Even so, Tank Battle: 1944 a no-overhead game with surprising staying power.


 There's a level in Super Mario Galaxy where Mario runs around a maze collecting a fixed number of coins within a certain time to win. Amazeing lemons (get it?) is kinda the same thing, but with lemons instead of coins. There are a few differences, of course:
 

 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   It's not Mario, but a first-person game.
   

  </li>
  <li>
   There's a jump, but you can't do much more than climb a wheelbarrow.
   

  </li>
  <li>
   Once in a while there's an orange that adds a minute to your time.
   

  </li>
  <li>
   There are no other levels.
  </li>
 </ul>
 

 I didn't find any major bugs, but there's nothing at all to the game: inoffensive music, no variation to the maze from game to game, simple report when time runs out, no option to change controls, etc. I haven't tried to win yet because it's hard to imagine it would be worth the effort. There could be a decent game here, but it would need some polish and variation. Too bad.


 I'm currently running the game and attempting to host a public game. Unfortunately, nobody else is playing the game and it appears there's no way to play the game without other players. There's also no way to back out of the wait screen without ending the game via the OS. So I haven't been able to play the game and I've gotten to know the options menu pretty well.
 

 

 The volume slider is kinda funky. When starting the game, the music (royalty free

 by Kevin MacLeod) plays at full volume. But when you go to the options menu, the slider is all the way to the left. Grabbing the slider and moving it to the right a bit turns down the volume. Putting the slider back to full left stops the music. This option is not saved, so if you don't want the music too loud, you need to do this process each time you start the game. And don't forget to do it before hitting the "Play" button as it's impossible to open the options menu after that point.
 

 

 You also start off the game in fullscreen at maximum quality and resolution. If I were going to be able to play the game, that would be fine. But all I can do is wait in the game lobby forever, so I want it to be windowed.
 

 

 I get that this is a game designed to be streamed for laughs. It would be a wasted
 <span class="bb_strike">

 development effort to implement bots. But surely the developers could have allowed players to enter the gamespace without an opponent at all. Since they didn't bother to make that available, this game is not playable at this time.


 <b>
  Delightful
 </b>
 is just the word to describe this game. I've only played a short demo of a Phoenix Wright game, but it's clear Aviary Attorney uses the same gameplay elements as the Ace Attorney series. Get a case, search for evidence, go to trial and cross examine witnesses. Each character has a clearly expressed relationship with other characters and there's a meta-narrative between the various denizens of the court. Having completed 2 cases, I can say they have provided light puzzles, enjoyable twists and dramatic stories.
 

 

 The art was provided by the public domain works of J. J. Grandville, who died in 1847. Each character is an animal drawn in human clothing and with human-looking expressions. The music is also public domain: Camille Saint-Saëns and other dead composers. Obviously these choices reduced costs, but they don't feel cheap. It took care to select each image and each musical cue. The characters are also animated and the music edited to fit the narrative. Plus the whole aesthetic works for a story set in 19th century Paris since it is from that time and place.
 

 

 I won't spoil the puzzles or the story. As fits this sort of game, the situations are contrived to provide intrigue. I found the humor fitting and often Dickensian. It leans heavily on puns and misunderstandings, which is fine in my book. So far I've glided through the conversations as smoothly as reading a particularly literary graphic novel. I'm only stopping to write this review to avoid devouring the entire game in one night.
 

 

 I do have a few minor gripes. The font used for dialog isn't kerned well. I noticed the lack of ligatures fairly quickly, which probably is a result of the print-style art. Good books from that era usually have excellent typesetting. But as I read more text, I became distracted by inconcistent spacing. It's probably not something most people would notice, but it does raise alarms in the unconcious.
 

 

 As with most puzzle games of this sort, it's inevitable that I will be thinking less about what the situation calls for me to do and more about what the game designer expects from players. I'm mostly in synch with the game logic, but a few times I guessed wrong. Having made my choice, the game went in a different direction than I expected. I don't know how to fix this, however.
 

 

 Overall, this is a compelling game that I heartily recommend.


 HPWIS is a game that very obviously draws inspiration from FTL. You got your ship that needs upgrading, crew who might get injured, encounters that often turn hostile, escape from an overwhelming nemesis and resource management. I've not played far, but it seems there are three reasons to get this game:
 

 

 1. You liked FTL and want to try out other, similar games.
 

 

 2. FTL was too difficult for you. (I've never completed a run myself.)
 

 

 3. Produce and cultural references amuse you.
 

 

 I won't say much about #3 as humor is a matter of taste. I didn't find it very funny, but you can always see what you think by playing the demo before buying.
 

 

 The other two points get at the game system at the heart of both games. HPWIS manages to be simpler than FTL without being streamlined. If anything, the choices feel more arbitrary and fiddly than FTL. Instead of targetting rooms on the enemy ship, weapons can either target the hull or one of the weapon systems. That elminates a lot of tactical choices. There's no worrying about whether your crew will survive if a fire spreads to the life support room. But there's also no targetting the enemy shield system either. Fewer things to go wrong on your ship means fewer things you can make go wrong on your enemy's.
 

 

 I'm still early in the game, but it doesn't feel easier than FTL. Combat seems easy enough, but I quickly ran into fights that seemed stacked against me. When I got through the exploration mission, I determined the problem was I hadn't upgraded anything since the tutorial had ended. It turns out you gotta upgrade your ship, weapons and crew in order to level up with the opposition. Some upgrades are obvious: more attack power or HP are good. Others are harder to evaluate. Do I want the charge capacitor that grows charge (the resource needed to fire a weapon) faster each turn or the one with a higher maximum charge? It's not that this is an easy choice. The problem is that it's not very interesting; just do some calculations and there's a right answer for your current weapon loadout.
 

 

 I suppose it isn't fair to compare this game to FTL. Maybe the systems will turn out to be deeper as I play more. But it's hard to recommend a lightweight version of FTL for 150% of the price. Maybe wait for it to go on sale and even then, only if you love the humor.


 The official blurb compares this game to chess and poker, which are accurate comparisons. But they sell the game short. Chaos Reborn remains the
 <b>
  very best tactical challenge
 </b>
 I've played whether computer or tabletop. Make no mistake: there is skill in playing a random set of spells, most of which have a chance to fail, that summon creatures whose attacks have a random chance to succeed. New players might blame losses on bad luck, but the experienced player knows that most matches are lost by poor decisions. Julian Gollop (of X-COM fame) masterfully coaxes incredible depth out of a fairly limited pallet of mechanics.
 

 

 If you read negative reviews, they tend to fall into two camps:
 

 <ol>
  <li>
   The game rewards luck, not skill.
   

  </li>
  <li>
   For a game with a multiplayer component, it's sometimes hard to
   

   get into a match.
  </li>
 </ol>
 The developers have worked on both complaints. The crux of Chaos is managing probabilities. That can be frustrating when a bad roll of the (metaphorical) dice causes you to loose a match. Law mode, which removes almost all the randomness, eliminates that frustration. The design is exceedingly clever as it alters a small number of mechanics to make a game that feels very different. Players spend mana (instead of a random chance of failure) to cast spells. Attacks reduce hit points (instead of a random chance of instant defeat). It's not much different than standard war games except for the illusion/disbelieve mechanic. Wizards can cast illusional units that behave like real units unless the enemy wizard disbelieves them. When that happens, illusions disappear in a puff of smoke.
 

 

 I don't feel this mode is entirely successful. One of the great strengths of Chaos is that neither side can relax until the enemy wizards have been swept from the field of battle. Bad luck cuts both ways. In Law mode, winning can be a matter of accumulating enough hit points to overwhelm the opposing army. It also seems as if the AI players are less competent when randomness is removed from the equation.
 

 

 The new mode unfortunately splits the already tiny player base. The good news is that Chaos Reborn offers plenty of ways to play. For one thing, you can queue up for a live dual and do other modes while you wait. A highlight of multiplayer is realms, which are campaigns of wizard battles created by high-level players. Beating realms earns you experience toward reaching those levels. By accepting invading wizards, you can increase the experience gains and get to play against humans rather than AIs. Or, you can invite other wizards to become allies to defeat especially difficult opponents.
 

 

 Live games are quick since there's a turn timer. But sometimes you can't spare the time. (It can also be a bit stressful to get your moves in once you have a bunch of units in play. One minute seems really long until you need to move half a dozen rats, spiders and skeletons using solid tactics.) Fortunately, Chaos Reborn is turned based and has asynchronous matches. You can set up custom matches with all sorts of match-ups from 1v1 to any combination of six players (bot or human). Or you can play league matches against 1 to 3 other players.
 

 

 The first time I tried league, I thought I'd go crazy and send three challenges. But after those games got going, I realized there's no reason not to load up on matches. At the moment, I have 57 games and am thinking about starting a few more. That way, I have a bunch of turns each time I log in. The only real downside is that I might lose those games if I don't play my turn within two days. The only time that happened was when I went on vacation and didn't want to be tempted to do work online.
 

 

 If you don't mind async games (and I love them) there are plenty of opponents to compete against. The benefit of a small community is that everyone seems to be pleasant to interact with. In some games there's no chatting, but other times people share tips in the in-game chat system. In the evenings, it's not uncommon for players to organize matches in the global chat room.
 

 

 Recently, the developers added guilds, which have renewed my interest in the game. Honestly, the in-game support is anemic. Mostly, it keeps track of guild stats in the various modes. The real value of guilds is that it encourages more co-op custom games and mentoring. I'm part of

 Bottom line:
 <b>
  If the game looks at all interesting, please try out the very
  

  generous demo. I think you'll want to buy if you give it a fair
  

  shake.
 </b>


 I got this game in early access and was delighted to play with the world's premiere (and only?) anthropomorphic rabbit hand-to-hand combat simlulator. It included a series of levels that told a loose story, but mostly gave you new scenarios to play around in: stealth attacks, arena combat, weapons and enemy variety, ambush possiblities, etc. Some levels were straight up (and I mean that literally) platforming sections that remind me of Prince of Persia. Humaniod rabbits have incredible jumping skills, so the cliffs are imposing, but not all that difficult to overcome.
 

 

 Combat is clearly the strength of the game. It's fast, brutal, fluid and deep with very simple controls. Combo moves arise from the mechanics and not pre-scripted animations. Weapons are well balanced. Large swords do incredible damage, but are slow to wield. Fists or a short knife can be better choices since you can drop in a few attacks and get out of the way of enemy slashes. With good timing, you can also disarm an opponent and use their weapon against them. Rabbits have a powerful jump kick attack that can cripple an enemy or, if you fail to time it correctly, result in a painful-looking backplant. As each fighter takes damage, blood spreads out from the wounds. It's a pleasure to watch albeit a guilty one.
 

 

 Unfotunately, the combat and jumping mechanics aren't enough to sustain long-term play. A game like this needs excellent level design. While I appreciated how vast and varied the landscapes, every location (at least as far as I got) used more or less the same textures. After release, I tried the new story mode and it seems to have fixed those problems. The levels are more interesting and strung together by a more coherent, if rambling, story. Everything looks better and I always knew which way to go for the next story beat.
 

 

 That said, the current game sometimes slows in the middle of intense fights. It's frusterating since the best part of combat is how a block flows into an attack followed by a dodge to another enemy ending in a throw. It's nice to have time to think about your next move, but I'd rather have the flow some fights offer. Dialing back the graphical options kills the good looks, but does nothing for the speed of action. I think I'll have to wait for performance updates or a new computer. (And to be fair, this is my laptop not a gaming rig.)


 To be clear, there's not a lot of game here. It reminds me of Myst without the puzzles or FMV.
 <b>
  And that's a very good thing.
 </b>
 There's a mysterious place for you to explore without having Myst's distractions. You can tell from the screenshots more or less what the place looks like, but the static image misses a stately dynamism. Better to wander through the world and experience it directly.
 

 

 There are 14 objects to find and achievements to associated with each. I found most of them in about 45 minutes and the last three when I came back to the game a few months later. Unfortunately, the gimmick of the game makes this task annoying.
 <span class="bb_spoiler">
  <span>
   An approaching comet is about to destroy the world.
  </span>
</details><br/>
 It results in a limited time period to explore before you are reset to the starting point. Fortunately, you begin in a central place, which minimizes travel after a reset, but the immediate area gets old quick.
 

 

 Movement through the environment is very floaty and feels faster than a run. This seems to be the result of a time distortion that causes time to pass slower for other objects than it does for you. It's an eerie effect. For instance, a statue falls apart in an arthouse film manner as you wander around the area. Meanwhile, the lighting changes over time as does the music when you approach an object.
 

 

 There are a few bits of text (once you touch an object), but they aren't as interesting as the world they are trying to augment. It's clear that these things were placed here for some purpose and the builders have left. We don't need to know more than that. I suspect the Anizasi would be a letdown if we knew them well enough.
 

 

 

 For what you get, it might be a bit pricy unless it goes on sale. Certainly worth the time.


 If I told you this game is Rogue meets a collectible card game meets Arkham Asylum and that it's
 <i>
  good
 </i>
 , I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't believe me. None of the elements are particularly deep, but the combination is. The game starts with a standard set of equipment cards and a deck of encounters. When beginning an adventure, the Dealer shuffles your encounter deck with some of his own and deals out (face down) a pattern that serves as your map. Each turn costs food to explore the next location (by flipping over the card). You might get enemies to fight, a shop or the exit. But sometimes you get a challenge that awards you new cards for your next adventure.
 

 

 Some of the challenges award you with the next part of a story. Each story is
 <i>
  just
 </i>
 interesting enough to not mind losing all your health and starting over. This isn't amazing writing, but just solid, workmanlike storytelling, which is rare enough in games. But you'll generally want to keep going in order to continue collecting more cards. You'll be collecting equipment, blessing and curses that change the rules of the game.
 

 

 Fighting enemies works a lot like the Batman brawler games. Success depends on reflexes, pattern memorization and having the right equipment. (It also helps to use a controller. Mouse and keyboard works, but combat is tuned for analogue stick and buttons.) One of the little pleasures is equipping a weapon, shield, armor or helmet that not only helps you fight better, but also changes the way your character model looks. In particular, I always am happy to get a helmet that replaces the fairly ugly default head. There's a clear effect in combat for each equiped item, blessing and curse. And the results of combat, particularly health lost and gold found, translate up to the card game. There are even maze encounters that challenge you to dodge through a series of traps to collect treasure of various sorts.
 

 

 All the while, the Dealer provides running commentary. It repeats quite a bit, but I always want to turn the sound on because the canned phrases are delivered so well and there's always new dialog added as you find new encounters. In a very real sense you are playing against the Dealer who wishes for your destruction, but always plays fair. Even the occasional three-er-four-card Monte you are forced to play from time to time can be won consistently if you watch carefully.
 

 

 In the end, this is a game that manages to be more than the sum of its gameplay elements.


 Dead6hot is, in essence, a copy of (free on Steam)
 <a class="bb_link" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/212800/Super_Crate_Box/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Super Crate Box
 </a>
 . To it's credit, it adds local multiplayer, which is a natural extension. However, it misunderstands what makes Super Crate Box so enjoyable. By adding health bars, limited ammo and multiple lives, the game loses its frantic energy. By removing the unlockables metagame, it loses the only other reason to play. Looks like an interesting project, but not one anybody should pay for in this state.


 The way to decide if this DLC is for you is to try a few rounds against bots in the free base game. If you want to keep playing, consider paying the modest price to get access to the single-player league. If you don't feel the urge to keep playing, save your money.
 

 

 The single player mode amounts to a series of bot battles strung together. Some challenges require teammates who can be hired from the bot pool. The score of each challenge is added up and players can see themselves on a global leaderboard. Challenges can be replayed and the highest score is recorded. The top few players each season are given a cash prize (via Paypal) from the developer. As I write it's the third season and I'm (somehow) in the position to win a prize. Obviously winning a prize would make up for the cost of the DLC, but I fully expect to be bumped from my spot before the end of the season by more dedicated players.
 

 

 The only other in-game benefit from the DLC is cosmetic armor pieces. Presumably these will make your avatar look different to other players. Also, you can see the top half of yourself since the game is third person. But otherwise, it's not significant.
 

 

 Finally, this DLC is a way for the developer to make money off the game. I hate to give this a negative review, but I just didn't enjoy the base game all that much. (My playing time was mostly so that I gave it a fair shake before reviewing.) But like I said, it's easy to try out the base game to see if you like it and then decide on your own whether to spend money on it.


 There's not a lot going for this game other than being short. It's just an unfortunate combination of rotten controls, fairly pedestrian puzzles and a sorta pretentious story.
 

 

 To describe the controls, imagine Myst where you can freelook in a low-polygon environment. It sounds fine in theory, but the mouse must be used both for looking and for clicking on stuff. Switching between those modes requires holding a mouse button to look. The camera remains stuck wherever you release the button. Sometimes the camera is readjusted when you click on something interesting, but normally you are looking at some random place when you move from one location to another. The whole scheme seems ripped out of the original System Shock, which hadn't figured out how to navigate a 3D environment. Not sure how this could be fixed, but it would have helped if the camera were adjusted in the direction of travel.
 

 

 The puzzles are maze- and item-based. I'm afraid they are typically either insultingly easy or annoyingly obtuse. There's an alligator puzzle that's mildly interesting.
 

 

 Now the game would be rescued if it had a clever story or engaging atmosphere. But this is no Thirty Flights of Loving. The short, disjointed story seems to be trying to say something about death, religion, environmentalism, corporate greed and the tedium of working life. It's not very cohesive. It feels like the game designers had an idea of what they wanted to say, but weren't able to pull it off.
 

 

 I don't hate the game, but Rituals isn't something I'd recommend spending time on.


 The premise of launching cubes in hopes of destroying the enemy pole/base is a good one. But the execution is not great. Most of the launchers are just random, but there's one that fires straight and true: the minigun. It's basically the only thing you ever need to build. Put it in front of your pole and you'll never lose. Enemy cubes that threaten your base get shot up and all the leftover bullets take down the enemy. There's only one winning strategy and everything else is (almost literally) a roll of the dice.
 

 

 In addition, the interface is off and there's too much waiting around for the currency system to let you build stuff. I guess these sorts of problems are to be expected with early access. But it doesn't seem like it'll be fixed anytime soon. Even if it is fixed, I think the game mechanics are too broken to be worth playing.


 Clash (sorry, CLASH) is a third-person, multiplayer shooter with a leveling scheme. Unfortunately, there aren't a ton of active users, so the game depends on bot competition. Fights with bots tend to be a matter of deciding whether to stand facing each other and chip away at their shields or run away if your own shields are failing. This doesn't seem like the right way to play, but I'm having a hard time figuring out the skill system. For some reason, I can only use each skill once. I must be missing something.
 

 

 The maps are more interesting than they first appear. It took awhile to figure it out, but holding the jump button (spacebar) activates a limited rocket jump ability. So the key to many of the maps is learning to jump up buildings or rock formations. That will let you attack from above and avoid being ambushed yourself. I'm guessing there are skills to be learned to improve jump height, but I haven't figured them out. More jumping would be great!
 

 

 I'm recommending this on the strength of being a free game that's still actively being developed. Would be improved with more players and less confusing leveling interface.
 

 

 Original review invalidated by developer fix:
 

 

 As far as I can tell, this game doesn't support inverting the Y-axis for mouse aiming. Which means when I try to line up a headshot, I'm quicking aiming straight up in the air or at my (non-existant) virtual boots. What little I played before giving up seemed interesting. But I can't reprogram my brain. Sorry!


 This is an early access game and it really shows. The good news is the developer really is working to fix bugs and improve the game. (A previous version of this review pointed out a few technical problems that were resolved in
 <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/467010/announcements/detail/1301948399258382552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  the next release
 </a>
 .)
 

 

 It's still too early to say how this game will be on release, but it shows promise as a post-apocalyptic tribal strategy game. I do wonder if it might benefit from some sort of fog of war system that would hide the movement of other tribes. For one thing, it would make exploration more interesting. For another, I get bored watching the turn play out on distant parts of the map I won't be visiting anytime soon.
 

 

 For the moment, I'm giving this a very tentative recommendation if you are interested in the theme and don't mind waiting for the game to develop.


 I'm not exactly a bullet hell shooter connoisseur, but I really enjoy Project Starship. It uses a sort of procedural generation scheme that introduces random enemies and powerups each time you play. Still, the enemy fire patterns are predictable once you've gotten to know and identify them. So there's definitely a learning curve and a chance to do better. Some power ups seem more useful than others, so you might find the game easier or harder depending on what you get. Not sure what a serious player would think, but I really like it as a casual.
 

 

 The aesthetic is firmly "early 90s arcade". When the game boots up, you can choose to add a CRT filter, which I appreciated on my 27" display. Then you are prompted to insert a coin (just hit the spacebar), chose a character (which changes the qualities of the ship and which character pops up at key moments) and pick either the easy or hard challenge. All the sprites are big and quirky. Enemies include frog legs, skulls, flames and a dozen different types of eyeballs. The projectiles are large and visually fill the screen. This is actually one of the few difficulties I had playing the game: it's not always clear where the hitboxes are. Music, sound effects and occasional voice clips add to the general sensory overload.
 

 

 Besides the random waves of enemies and occasional boss battle, the game includes "Mad Events". These are announced in huge letters and then the game shifts to a game mode all about dodging. Instead of an enemy firing projectiles, the projectiles just appear and move in a fixed pattern. With nothing to shoot at, your goal becomes to survive for a few seconds. These seem unfair (I hope you got some shield power ups!) but are a useful change of pace.
 

 

 I gather there is a local co-op option and various extra game modes, but I haven't tried those options yet. The new modes would require me to beat the game. Even on easy, this is a difficult game. For the most part, it seems possible to avoid getting hit, but I'm not nearly good enough or patient enough to get better. Even so, I'm enjoying the experience. It's not as frustrating as most difficult games.
 

 

 Finally, this game is funny. There's an item called "TV Doesn't Work" that temporarily changes the screen to static. (It also clears enemies and bullets from the screen.) Obviously my monitor hadn't stopped working, but to the extent I was drawn into the fiction that I was playing a game on a CRT, it's an effective practical joke. This is the sort of visual gag that can only make sense in the context of a video game.


 The conceit of the game is that you are running a gun store in a zombie apocalypse. That's a fine setup, but the execution is just a mess. The core of the game is buying guns at a low price and selling at a high price. Setting the price you want to offer is a fiddly mouse wheel (?!) adjustment. Then you play a minigame where you try to stop a spinning arrow within a colored area of a circle. The further away from the base price you've bid, the harder the minigame. It's not a very fun game and it really makes no sense in the game's fiction. It's just a system to add skill (of a sort) to negotiations. If you fail the game too many times, the other party leaves unhappy.
 

 

 As you buy guns, you ought to place one of them under your pillow for the inevitable zombie invasion. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell which slot is your pillow. When the zombies come, I seem to have used the least effective gun available. At first, I assumed I'd control the shooter, but it seems to be automatic. In any case, I have yet to survive an invasion.
 

 

 In the end, the mechanics kill this game. The concept is not nearly interesting enough to endure a tiresome minigame and counterintuitive interfaces. I'd skip this one.


 This is a followup to City of Chains, but not as competent or interesting. Annoyingly, I spent several minutes in the hub/hideout area not finding a way to advance. (It's a computer terminal on the back wall.) Once in the dungeon areas, movement is nothing more than chosing a direction. Most rooms are empty and there's no way to tell which direction will have something interesting. So you mostly wander around until you feel like taking on the final encounter.
 

 

 It's possible that more playing time will reveal more interesting decisions. But the core game just isn't interesting enough to find out.


 City of Chains uses a competent JRPG combat system to tell an "Escape from LA/NY"-style story. There are a few interesting ideas here, such as tying limited ammo to special attacks and avoiding combat by tossing a granade instead. Despite the budget graphics, this seems to be a solid game worth playing for those who enjoy this sort of story. (That said, I prefer the Shadowrun series which is more polished.)


 I would really like to recommend this game as it feels like a spiritual successor to Yars' Revenge. Like Yars, defeating the enemies requires a two step process: clear a vertical line in the grid and then shoot the boss though the gap you created. The only way to get a shot is to gather three globs of a single color without touching another color. So the core of the game is deciding which color to gather and deciding when to shoot the canon.
 

 

 Meanwhile, the enemy occationally drops a black glob, which will end the game if it reaches the floor. The canon can destroy the glob, but it can take a while to collect more colors for another shot. A made shot can move the player to the next screen and a missed shot can doom the player to destruction. This is very much the same sort of tension you feel in Yars when preparing to make the final shot. It's a good design and more challenging that it first looks.
 

 

 Radical Spectrum: Volume 1 isn't quite as compeling as Yars' Revenge, however. (For a glipse into that game's design, read

 .) It's just too slow and repeative. But for the price, it's worth trying out if you enjoy thinking about action game mechanics.


 Mac version doesn't work through Steam. While installing does download an exectable, Steam can't find it. Playing outside Steam doesn't save the game, however.
 

 

 Purgatory is a budget title that I can't quite recommend because it's not interesting enough for me to keep playing. The concept (tactical RPGish wargame) is fine. The purgatory setting is promising (but you can get a similar effect playing Skulls of the Shogun). The AI seems competent. But this is just a series of tedious battles fought on a barren hexgrid. As in, there is no terrain at all. So it's just a matter of coaxing the enemy into your attack radius before you wander into theirs. Attacks also always hit and cause about the same amount of damage as far as I can tell. There just aren't enough interesting choices.
 

 

 It also lacks a few polish niceties such as being able to tab between units and seeing at a glance which are leveled up.


 Tried to play this on my Mac and nothing got installed. Then I switched to Windows, which at least worked. However, sometimes my clicks didn't register and there's no option to exit the game.
 

 

 As for the game itself, it's a matter of chosing upgrades and waiting for cooldowns. Since all units share one cooldown and all spells share another, it makes the most sense to maximize upgrades on one unit and one spell. That way, you can spam that unit and spell until the enemy is beaten back.
 

 

 The AI isn't brilliant. It obviously just has a shorter cooldown and more advanced units. The only real challenge is trying upgrade setups until you find one that works on each level. Otherwise, it's just a matter of clicking buttons the split second the cooldown ends. Bizzarely, the spell and unit cooldown are the same length of time. So I guess there's a small level of strategy deciding which you ought to click first.
 

 

 Given a glut of free tower defense games with better conceived mechanics, there's no need to give this one a second look.


 As a twin-stick shooter, this is uninteresting. There are minor upgrades in weapons and abilities after each boss battle. Otherwise, dodge bullets and shoot an infinate supply of enemies.
 

 

 As a topdown GTA clone, it's only charm is the doodle graphics style. Otherwise, it's just killing people trying to kill you with cars or guns. In my first 3 "missions" the only goal is to go into a bank (not sure why it's a bank other than the name on the roof) and kill someone with a better gun than I have.
 

 

 Maybe there's more? I don't think so and I'm not interested enough to find out.


 A little like what Metroid would have been on the Atari 2600: colorful, blocky, short and challenging. The one boss battle I've seen is slightly frusterating; as far as I can tell, there's no way to prepare, so you gotta repeat until you get lucky. Fortunately, the save system is generous and the platforming is fair.
 

 

 Like the original Metroid, I probably won't finish this. I don't feel like the reward for getting better will be worth the effort. The price is right for trying out Dungeon of Zolthan, however.


 Why someone might do it, I have no idea. Thirty Flights of Loving is a videogame immitation of French New Wave cinema. Along with Gravity Bone (which is included) the experience takes about half an hour—far less time than an artsy movie. Emotionally, it carries a similar impact perhaps because you are an actor in the piece. While there is no danger of making a wrong choice, there is a sense of peril. Even though it is impossible to explore the characters, there's an impression of romance and friendship. A simple plot is complicated by a trick of chronological confusion, but I still feel it has added meaning somehow.
 

 

 On the whole, this is a game you play in order to think, talk and write about later. It probably deserves a replay after you've had time to contemplate. (I haven't done that yet.) In addition, I'm looking forward to the commentary option. If you are into that sort of thing, there are far worse things to spend your money on.


 XCOM (2012) meets Crusader Kings II with a eurogame design aesthetic.
 

 

 If you are a fan of those games (or even one of them), Massive Chalice is worth a playthrough. XCOM was already a streamlined remake of X-COM, so you might wonder how it could be further simplified. The solution is reducing resources that need to be managed to just bloodlines, territory and "Research". The later can be used to get new technology, build out infrastructure and aquire new heros. Instead of the slightly complicated system of engineers, scientists and money, you can build one project at a time and speed it up by dedicating heroes to become lifetime "Sagewrights". They can't fight for you anymore, which is always the tradeoff when assigning heroes to special positions.
 

 

 It's a similar situation with expanding your bloodlines: dedicate heroes to become "Regents" and marry them to start having children. This part of the game take the primary decisions in CKII (arraigning marriages) and removes minor (and fiddly) decisions like assigning counsel duties and building structures in each county. The overworld game operates on a puasable realtime system, but unlike other games you don't spend much time waiting around.
 

 

 It helps that there's a steady diet of random events such as deciding whether to punish heroes who have children out of wedlock. While I enjoy these bits of story, I can see how they can be frusterating for people who enjoy strategy. The results seem to be random even when you see the same event in a later playthrough. Sometimes forgiving the couple gives them a positive personality stat and othertimes a negative one. It's never possible to make a perfect decision. For me, however, this is just the right level of chrome.
 

 

 XCOM fans might be disappointed that heroes age and die off whether you play well or not. Massive Chalice seems to want players to be invested in bloodlines (AKA, dynasties in CKII) rather than individuals. Parents randomly pass genetic traits to children and also determine the hero class. Bloodlines specialize in one of three base classes: ranged, melee and area damage. These classes can be combined by marriage to create interesting dual-classed heroes. Once you get the concept of managing families rather than a team of individuals, the game will be less frustering.
 

 

 The tactical game starts fairly slowly, but as you develop technologies and bloodlines your tactics change. Meanwhile enemy forces bring new powers to the fight. The forces of chaos invading your nation are called "Cadence". Appropriately, their sortees come at regular intervals for 300 in-game-years. Fighting isn't too different from XCOM in terms of feel, but heroes start with fewer options. As you develop your bloodlines and technology, new and surprising tactics are opened up. Because of the bloodline mechanism, it'll take several playthroughs to see all the possibliites.
 

 

 Unfortunately, the tactical maps start to feel samey after a few battles in the same regions. If they are proceedurally generated, the just isn't enough variablity. (I have the same problem with XCOM, which is odd considering X-COM (1994) largely avoids the problem.) Other then the occational base defense missions, most fights settle into careful seek-and-destroy excersises. Cranking up the difficulty helped a bit.
 

 

 I tend to play these games in Ironman mode as it remove the tempation to break immersion by save scumming. This worked great until the final showdown when I accidently

 . With no option to restart the mission, I was stuck starting the entire game from scratch. I'll probably want to do this at some point, but I don't think it'll happen until I've mostly forgotten the slow start.
 

 

 In summary, Massive Chalice does a great job of feeding the player with a steady diet of meaty decisions. But there isn't quite enough spice to sustain the mulitiple playthroughs needed to explore all the choices. A faster start and more variety in tactical maps would have helped.


 I feel a bit churlish criticizing Nina Freeman's passion project, but I'm afraid I can't recommend Cibele. It's an autobiography told with three techniques: live-action video, documents on the protagonist's desktop, and a simplified, simulated MMO. Watching the videos, which are mostly shot in what looks like a teenage girl's bedroom, feels unconfortably voyeristic to me. Just as creepy is sorting through the images, documents, chat logs, and emails. I don't enjoy prying into someone else's life, so I probably missed a fair amount of content. A fully written or cinematic version of the story might have appealed more.
 

 

 However, playing the imagined MMO fills in a piece of the story that can't easily be replicated some other way. Don't suppose the game to be particularly complicated; the only action is clicking on enemies to attack them. As you play, the main characters talk the way people (presumably) talk over in-game voice chat. Other characters interrupt with emails and typed chat messages. The stress of managing the demands of the game and multiple conversations must be experienced to be felt. This section of the game is very effective.
 

 

 As the story progresses, the game-within-a-game's art style foreshadows and mirrors the emotions characters feel. But it's not at all clear why they are playing. Perhaps because I've never played much of this sort of game myself, but the gameplay does not strike a chord of recognition for me. Aren't there strategies besides rapid clicking? Even a few fake mechanics such as added equipment, leveling, and special attacks would sustain the illusion of an online game that would entertain players for several years.
 

 

 I can't bear the game any ill-will. It's kinda interesting as an experiment. But the story just did not grab me and there's very little else.


 In the search for the ideal top-down tactical shooter, I've tried Hotline Miami (too twitchy), Forzen Synapse (too random), Monaco (close, but too gimmicky), and recent XCOMs (on the abstract side). None of them quite scratch the itch created by Julian Gollop games. Until Door Kickers.
 

 

 The heart of the game is a series of buildings your SWAT team must clear of bad guys. Sometimes there's another objective such rescuing hostages or collecting evidence before the suspects can destroy it. These require various tactics and give the game flavor. But the core remains moving from one room to the next shooting people who are trying to shoot you.
 

 

 Every character possesses some level of agency. Enemies (AKA, tangos) respond to sounds and other cues in reasonable ways. For instance, they might turn to face the door your pointman is forcing. Alternatively, they might decide to shoot the hostages or destroy the evidence. Your operators might ignore orders in order to respond to immediate threats. In fact, you don't order them to fire at all; you tell them where to go and they just take care of business.
 

 

 As a result, you can set up a plan at the start of a level and let the game play itself. I know that sounds boring, but it really isn't. Plans involve dozens of little decisions, such as how to breach a door, where to toss a flashbang, when to turn to check a hallway and so on. You can charge though most levels with a lone shooter (there are achievements for it) or carefully coordinate a full team with go signals. If your plan works, the payoff is a minute or two of perfectly choreographed violence.
 

 

 Truthfully, however, perfect planning doesn't happen the first time around. More often I need to adjust because I failed check a blind spot or I blundered into shotgun crossfire. Plans can be redrawn on the fly or you can pause the action to give yourself time to think. Immediately after completion of a level, I find myself restarting it so that I can fine tune the plan.
 

 

 There is an overarching game of unlocking tactics, roles and armament. Faster times unlock up to three stars for buying new guns, body armor and equipment. Officers earn experience points which open up new roles (assaulter, breacher, stealth and shield) and tactics. Missions can technically be played in any order, but the effect of the leveling system is to gate off more difficult levels. Skipping missions or forgetting to upgrade increases the challenge quickly.
 

 

 On the other hand, once you have a stronger team, it's rewarding to go back to earlier levels and get an improved result. In addition, campaigns are unlocked once your squad levels up to a certain point. However, don't think of campaigns as stories since they are just missions strung together to force you to pay the consequences for deaths and injuries. I'd complain campaigns are too shallow if I weren't excited to play new maps.
 

 

 Not that there's any lack of maps. In addition to 84 single missions and 6 campaigns, there are user-created missions for download and a map generator. These mean you will never need to play the same mission over again, but they also highlight the skill of official level designers. Levels designed by other users are wildly inconstant in challenge and quality. The generated levels can be anywhere from boring to near impossible depending on which settings you use and how the random number generator rolls.
 

 

 In the final analysis, Door Kickers provides copious amounts of tactical decision making with simple controls and plenty of chrome.
