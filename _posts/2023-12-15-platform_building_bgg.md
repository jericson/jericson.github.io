This is part two in an ongoing series looking at community platforms:

1. [Stack Overflow](/2023/11/04/platform_building_so.html)
2. [BoardGameGeek](/2023/11/06/platform_building_bgg.html)

## What is BGG?

[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Welcome_to_BoardGameGeek)
(or BGG for those in the know) stands out as a community platform
because it has:

1. close to 100% name recognition within the board game hobby and
2. close to 0% name recognition outside of it.


BGG (née ["BoardgameGeek
Database"](https://web.archive.org/web/20000816005955/http://www.boardgamegeek.com/))
opened its forums on July 9, 2000 and allowed users to submit games to
the database on July 27.  The core of BGG is a database of nearly ever
board game ever designed. The rules around [submitting a game to the
database](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_Guide_to_Game_Submissions)
strictly define a game as opposed to a puzzle or other activity.
Defining the scope of a community like this turns out to be a vital
component of a [community
startup](/2021/08/19/community_startup.html). That ensures everyone is
looking the same sort of thing.

Speaking of which, here's what a game page looks like:

[![Example BGG game page with specific features called out that I will
describe
below.](/images/bgg_game_page.png)](/images_raw/bgg_game_page.png)

(Select the image to get a full-sized screenshot.)

I've numbered some important items on the page above the fold:

1. BGG serves ads directly targeted to board gamers. Given the need
   for revenue, this is a win all the way around. Visitors see ads for
   products they care about, advertisers get a better return on their
   investment and BGG gets more revenue than if it served
   [programmatic
   ads](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/resources/trainings/grow-digital-ad-revenue/understand-direct-and-programmatic-ad-revenue/). A
   huge advantage of that well-defined community is that it makes
   selling ad space to relevant companies _much_ easier. This is
   one reason to resist the temptation expand the scope rather
   than spin off a new community. (More below.)
2. Members can give games a rating from 1 to 10 with [each number
   having a distinct
   meaning](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/38927/bgg-ranking-and-rating-system-flaws-advantages-and). Based
   on community ratings, [Teotihuacan: City of
Gods](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/229853/teotihuacan-city-gods) was ranked 83
   overall and 62 among strategy games. That's among the best rated
   games ever, which is important since BGG rank drives game sales.
3. Every game can be edited by users. Admins review some changes and
   others go through
   [GeekMod](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/GeekMod), which is a
   collaborative voting system. Community members can earn
   [GeekGold](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/GeekGold) for
   submitting various corrections. What you see on the page comes
   almost entirely from user submissions, which includes users who are
   publishers and designers of games. It's in their best interest to
   keep the database updated and complete because consumers use it to
   make purchase decisions.[^2]
4. Teotihuacan has an average rating of 7.9, which is quite high. If
   you click the number, you'll get a breakdown of how many people
   gave each rating, comments (mini-reviews) and all sort of
   statistical data BGG has collected. Every time I look I see metrics
   and stats I hadn't seen before. Most people don't care, but the
   people who do care [get a lot out of the
   data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/designing-the-best-board-game-on-the-planet/).
5. Many games include player count, play time and age recommendations
   on the side of the box. BGG also lets the community suggest the
   best player counts and age limits, which work better than the
   publisher's numbers thanks to the wisdom of the
   crowd. Additionally, the community can give games [a complexity
   rating](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight) that can help
   potential players decide what the play. Teotihuacan is fairly heavy
   so it might not be a good choice for new players.
6. Community members interact with games in a variety of ways:
   * Rate the game.
   * Add the game to lists.
   * Log play sessions.
   * Mark the game as a favorite.
   * Subscribe to updates of the game page.
   * Find places to buy a copy. This is a revenue opportunity for BGG
     thanks to a commission if people purchase via the link. People
     can also sell used games via the
     [GeekMarket](https://boardgamegeek.com/market), which nets BGG a
     fee. And BGG sells  games on [its own
     store](https://boardgamegeekstore.com/).
7. After the main game information tile, there's a standard menu for
   finding out more about the game. Forums are important, of course,
   but you might look for a copy of the rules under Files or browse
   Images and Videos. There's overlap between this navigation and the
   buttons in the info card because the info card.
8. This Overview Video explains Teotihuacan at a high level and
   promotes [GeekUp Bits for the
   game](https://boardgamegeekstore.com/search?q=Teotihuacan&options%5Bprefix%5D=last). What
   are those? In the last few years there's been a market for improved
   components for popular games. You can [find them on
   Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=Teotihuacan+game&ref=search_bar)
   and BGG got into the business as well. A common upgrade is wood
   replacements for cardboard game pieces. The video itself was
   produced by BGG and does an excellent job selling the best features
   of the game.
9. Meanwhile the Watch it Played! video for the game comes from [a
   popular YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WatchItPlayed)
   that makes instructional videos for games.[^1] These videos are
   sponsored by the game publisher so that people can learn how the
   game works in detail before they buy or play the first time. BGG
   has some hand in producing these videos as well.
   
Not ever game will have all of these items, of course. Less popular
games, such as
[MimocirQ](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355918/mimocirq), which
I submitted to the database, show the bones of the structure. For more
popular games, a handful of details copied from the game box are
enough to set up a place for community engagement. In addition to
general forum discussions, the community contributes content such as
rules variants, strategy guides, complete expansions, detailed
reviews, etc. I've even received a comment from the designer of [a
game I'd
reviewed](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2962774/faults-its-stars). BoardGameGeek
has become the central hub for the hobby. It's a virtuous feedback
cycle in which community contributions provide value to everyone in
the board game industry which, in turn, attracts more community
contributions.

Right now BGG is doing [a fund-raising
drive](https://boardgamegeek.com/support). When people contribute they
have a chance to submit a quote that might be randomly selected to be
shown in the fund-raising banner:

While browsing the site to write this post, I collected quotes praising BGG:

## Getting started with BGG

It's been nearly 4 years since my first contribution to BGG: a
[somewhat negative review of
Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2338760/best-if-played-quickly). After
playing with my family and reading glowing reviews, I wanted to share
my disappointment. (Getting people over the ["nothing to share"
feeling](https://www.feverbee.com/nothing-to-share/) is the key to
community participation.) After posting my review . . . nothing
happened. It didn't show up in the forums and I must have clicked away
from the page that explained reviews are, well, reviewed by the
GeekMod system. Why reviews and not other posts? I'm still not sure.

When my review did get posted, I got a bit of GeekGold. Not nearly
enough to buy an avatar, but it did solve the mystery of why some
people have avatars and others don't. Then I started getting comments
disagreeing with some of the points I'd made. I've since learned that
I was a bit unlucky since expressing negative feelings about popular
games gets people defensive. I've learned to anticipate this
phenomena.

So many things about the BGG on-boarding experience are bizarre and
unexplained. Oh you _can_ find out how it works, but not by trying to
do things on the site. It wouldn't surprise me that people don't
contribute as much as they would if a user experience expert revamped
the system. BGG makes up for that deficiency by having obvious value
for people who want to learn more about board games. I jumped through
various hoops to become a contributor because the community had
clearly demonstrated the value of contributions. My Wingspan review
resonated with other people and that feels fantastic.

## The BGG network

BGG branched out to [RPGGeek](http://rpggeek.com/) and
[VideoGameGeek](http://videogamegeek.com/). Both use the same
software, but neither has anything like the same reach (as far as I
can tell) in their respective communities. I mentioned in my [look at
Stack Overflow](/2023/11/04/platform_building_so.html) that the Stack
Exchange network was sorely neglected. It looks like BGG's video fame
spin-off didn't get as much attention as the flagship. There are many
other places to get information about video games, such as
[IGN](https://www.ign.com/reviews/games) and [Rock Paper
Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/). 

The site for RPGs shares enough with board games that it got some of
the more recent style changes and features like listings on the
GeekMarket. It also has targeted advertising from Kickstarter
campaigns. Without financial details its hard to know for sure, but I
expect RPGG more than justifies its costs. Even VGG probably pays for
itself from the annual fundraising drive. 

The network is a sure sign BGG is a community platform since it
reuses functionality in a new context. VGG uses a little less of the
platform and that's ok. Maybe BGG overestimated demand or maybe demand
dried up. Whatever the case, there little to gain by shutting the
community down as long as it continues to provide value to
visitors. The time to shut down a community is when it [can't moderate
itself](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites).

## Community for the long-haul

I don't know how long BGG will last. It's currently riding a
[Kickstarter-fueled](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) boom, so
everything looks good for now. Has the company over-extended itself?
There's no way to know, at least from the outside. What I can say is
that it continues to make itself more useful for the board game hobby
and has a revenue model to directly benefit from community
engagement. The industry might suffer setbacks, but as long as people
play board games, there will be a demand for what BoardGameGeek
offers.

[^1]: These videos explain the games well and are quite entertaining
    thanks to the personality of the hosts. [Rodney
    Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvO56nMhBxkIYawlL0SpgIg)
    founded the channel and is particularly engaging. These videos are
    fun to watch even if you already know how to play the game.

[^2]: I numbered these sections a month ago and I had a definate
    reason for putting 4 after 3. I just don't remember it. I also
    can't find the screenshot I was editing to swap the numbers so
    you'll just have to live with an imperfect flow.
