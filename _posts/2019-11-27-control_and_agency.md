Last week Stack Overflow had a meetup with the entire company in
Austin, Texas. I always love meeting people in person who I normally
interact with online. So much is lost when you don't have non-verbal
cues.

One of the sessions in the meetup was a presentation of some work we
are doing to
[restore the feedback loop between the company and the Stack Overflow community](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/25/introducing-the-loop-a-foundation-in-listening/). As
valuable as our meta sites have been over the years, they just haven't
scaled well. Since I'm leading the "Better Mechanisms for Community
Feedback" section, I got a chance to speak about the project. I
started off by saying I had a role in creating Meta in the first
place. I left
[this suggestion on UserVoice](https://web.archive.org/web/20090522110810/http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com:80/pages/1722-general/suggestions/106921-provide-an-authorized-location-for-meta-discussion-)
which was the original way to provide feedback about the site. That
suggestion was
[quoted in the announcement of meta](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/28/cmon-get-meta/).

Someone in the crowd (I couldn't see who because of the stage
lighting) shouted out "So it's your fault!" I replied that it was and
proceeded to profess my love of Meta in a totally unplanned _ad
libitum_. For all it's faults, Meta is full of people who care about
the site and how it operates. Having talked to owners of other
community platforms, it's rare to have that sort of passion. Having
too much feedback isn't really a problem most sites have to worry
about.

Later in the week, someone mentioned
[the Meta reaction to our license change](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333089/stack-exchange-and-stack-overflow-have-moved-to-cc-by-sa-4-0). The
word this person used was "control". While we did change the overall
license this time, we
[failed to change the license specifically for code](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272956/a-new-code-license-the-mit-this-time-with-attribution-required)
a couple of years ago in large part to feedback from folks on our meta
sites. Instead of making a necessary change, it seems the company
allowed the voices on meta to decide. We also talked about how
difficult it can be to make design changes on the sites because of
[hypercritical feedback](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314089/what-does-constructive-criticism-of-a-design-change-look-like). Again,
the person I was talking to put this down as an issue of control. Why
do we let users complain about the colors and fonts our professional
designers have picked out?

It's clear how the narrative of control explains a lot of what we see
on Meta:

1. The company announces a change to the site.
2. People on Meta object strenuously to the change.
3. The company either bows to pressure or faces the ongoing griping
   from people who want to control what we do.

But is this narrative _true?_

I can't speak for other users and I
[tend to do poorly when I try](https://jlericson.com/2019/05/20/meristocracy.html),
so I'll speak for myself. What motivated me to complain about
UserVoice? Was it because I wanted more control over Stack Overflow?
It was way back in 2009, so there's a chance I don't remember
accurately. But I did leave a few comments:

All these jibe with my memory. I was seeing people ask about the site
on the site. Even at that early stage, such questions were not
welcome. So my concern was give people a discoverable outlet for their
questions about the site. Control wasn't really my concern at all.

Instead I was interested in **agency**. I saw a problem, felt helpless
to do anything about it and asked for a tool (_any_ tool) to help
out. In the early stages of Stack Overflow, before it built up a
critical mass of helpful volunteers, it really didn't have anything to
offer beyond what other communities already offered. But the founders
of Stack Overflow invited people to be a part of the development
process by blogging and podcasting about major decisions along the
way. Even though we didn't have any real control over the way the site
was built, we did have agency. We did have input.

It's obvious Meta no longer has the sort of agency it used to. When I
proposed a space for meta-discussion, the people who made the
decisions were paying attention. With so many conversations going on
now (and even more having occurred in the past) on meta sites around
the network, it's pretty unlikely that any one argument will sway
development. Meta has always been a hack, but now it's barely
functioning at all as a feedback mechanism.

My task, therefore, is to find a way for the people making decisions
within the company to hear voices from the community that represent a
wide variety of interests. That way when we contemplate changes that
affect the community, we will have a good idea of how people (even
people who never go to Meta) will respond. There's never a promise
we'll do what you ask (control), but we're renewing our commitment to
take your input into account (agency). If we (the company _and_ the
community) improve our feedback loops, there's a chance for _everyone_
to be better off than we are now.
