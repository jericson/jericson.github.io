    <p>
      First, I want you to know that my cold has finally left me for
      the second time.  Now, for the events of the past week:
    </p>
    <p>
      Last Saturday: I went to Xochimilco (Mexico´s version of Venice,
      Italy) with my team in the morning and had a great time relaxing
      while we were conducted through the canals.  We shopped in a
      market by the embarcadero (dock) in the afternoon and I bought a
      beautiful lace tablecloth with a cala lily pattern for only 80
      pesos (a little over $8).  In the evening we gave an evangelism
      workshop and went out to talk to people in the neighborhood.  I
      talked with some of the saddest teens I have ever met.  They
      were so apathetic that I don´t think they would have cared if
      they died that evening, and they cared even less about where
      they might go when they die.  One, Saul, is a Satan worshiper I
      think and as the three of us talked to him I began to wonder if
      he was possessed or something.  His eyes were so vacantly dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday: The famous Pastor Tilopillo (the voice of John MacArthur
      on Spanish radio) preached at our church because he was in town
      for a conference he was leading.  He was a good enough preacher,
      but I don´t think I was as impressed as all the hermanos at
      church.  In the afternoon, we went to <a
      href="image/coyocan.jpg">Coyocan</a> with some of the young
      people from church and had fun despite all the New Age hippies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday: I traveled out to Jon´s church to watch his team´s clown
      show, meet his family (how many girls get to meet their
      boyfriend´s family for the first time twice), and climb "The
      Mountain" with them.  The path up was kinda hard but had enough
      rocks to get a sure footing.  The main challenge was getting
      enough air since my chest was still full of phlegm.  Let´s just
      say that on the way down the ground kept moving out from under
      me and I went down the longest sand slide in the world.  I was
      black with dirt when we reached the bottom, and Jon was giggling
      because he was having so much fun at the expense of my personal
      hygiene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday: I got to talk with a few of our students about Jesus
      and the Bible before English Class, and that was a great
      encouragement since so many of our other students are from the
      church.  I also got to eat a chocolate-covered popsicle for the
      first time in weeks, and that was a great treat.  I borrowed
      <u>Shadow of the Almighty</u> from the Spearhead library and
      have enjoyed reading about Jim Elliot´s life in his own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday: I took my final exam for Spanish class.  Not much
      else exciting happened that I can remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday: We had a party to celebrate the end of Spanish
      classes.  That night after it stopped raining, I washed my
      clothes outside at night for the first time.  They finally dried
      today after getting wet again yesterday.  I can´t wait to use my
      parents´ washing machine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday: We went to the water park at Oaxtepec an hour south of
      the city.  I got to relax without getting a sun burn (I think
      Jon avoided one too).  The drive though the mountains was
      gorgeous as always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday (today): We had a clown show again this morning and it
      went great.  Even though we hadn´t practiced in two weeks, I
      think our performance was better.  The location was much better,
      and the children were very receptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praises:
    <ul>
      <li>I´m well.</li>
      
      <li>God has given me some vision for what He wants me to do with
      myself outside of class this next school year.</li>

      <li>After talking to our papá about how important it is to
      celebrate things if they are special to one´s spouse, he renewed
      his habit of brining her random useful gifts after work.</li>

      <li>Jon gets to be a computer geek and help out the Spearhead
      office situation this next week.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayer requests:
    <ul>
      <li>That we would be able to make it through the three clown
      shows we have this week without getting too tired or losing our
      voices.</li>

      <li>Guidance for Jon and me as we continue to mold our
      relationship to God´s desires.</li>

      <li>Continued vision and guidance in the area of ministry (both
      here and at home).</li>

      <li>Good use of free time these next weeks as the end of Spanish
      classes will leave me with a lot more time on my hands.</li>

      <li>Just the right attendance and just the right lessons to
      teach in English this week since I´m the one responsible for
      teaching.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
Thank you again for all of your support, especially through
encouragement and prayer.  I took three rolls of film to be
developed today and I look forward to using the photos to share
about my trip with you.<br>
Joy&lt;&gt;&lt;
