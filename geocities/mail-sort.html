    <h1 class="title">Mail Sorting Strategies</h1>

    <p>
      Think a moment about how you read mail.  If you're like me,
      there are certain people whose messages you want to read right
      away and others whose messages you'd rather not read at all.  If
      you are subscribed to a mailing list or two, you might want to
      group those messages together.  Some messages you'll want to
      keep for years and be able to find after a few minutes of
      searching.  Some messages are from colleagues and others are
      from friends.  Your work life and home life are
      separate&mdash;why isn't your work and home mail?  If you
      recognize these small frustrations using email, you, my friend,
      need automated mail sorting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most mail programs offer the option (if you can find it) to sort
      messages into different mailboxes based on information found in
      email headers.  For instance a really simple strategy would be
      to sort mail to boxes based on the From header.  If I sent you a
      message, your mail program might create a box named "Jon
      Ericson" and move my messages there.  Or you could sort everyone
      who sends you mail into the "Friends" and "Foes" mailboxes.  As
      a matter of fact, most of my sorting rules make use of the From
      header.  I can normally predict what sort of things a
      person will mail me about.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to keep mailing list messages together, the From
      header is unreliable and awkward.  That's because list server
      software preserves the From header when it forwards mail to its
      list.  Fortunately it normally adds other headers for the
      purpose of allowing easy sorting and as a sort of signature.
      A fairly reliable thing to look for is the address of the list
      in the Sender header.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we've looked at "whitelist" strategies: sorting messages
      from people you want to receive messages from.  Most people are
      driven to mail sorting because they want to "blacklist" certain
      types of messages.  Most of us would like to never again see the
      get-rich-quick schemes, Viagra and diploma sales pitches,
      invitations to visit pornographic web pages, and
      who-knows-what-they-say foreign language emails.  The From
      header is rarely useful, since spammers tend to use some bogus
      Hotmail, Yahoo! or AOL address.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the epic battle between large ISPs (who get the majority of
      complaints) and the spammers (who are attracted to the huge
      number of accounts) victory goes to the innovator.  When ISPs
      blocked spam with identical Subject headers to thousands of
      subscribers, spammers began including random numbers pushed to
      the end by spaces.  So a simple blacklist rule is to junk
      subjects with more than 2 spaces in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you can also censor based on certain words in the
      Subject.  My earliest spam filter was to junk messages with the
      string 'sex' in the Subject.  Naturally I lost a message a few
      days later because one of my colleagues misspelled consecutive.
      The first lesson to learn is that you should <em>never</em>
      throw mail away without glancing over it first.  For this
      reason, my blacklisted mail goes to the Junk mailbox, not to the
      trash.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The second lesson is to be sure to filter <em>words</em> not
      <em>strings</em>.  Maybe I don't want to read what strangers
      might have to say about <em>sex</em>, but perhaps I would be
      interested in messages about <em>sex</em>tants.  (On the other
      hand I suppose I don't care about <em>sex</em>tons.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most important lesson though is to whitelist filter
      aggressively before you blacklist.  You know from deduction that
      emails from coworkers are usually about work.  You know from
      induction that emails about sex are usually spam.  So your
      whitelist rules tend to be more certain than your blacklist
      rules.

      Here's the code (Emacs lisp) that splits my mail:
      <br/>
      <br/>

<code>
(setq nnmail-split-methods 'bbdb/gnus-split-method)

(setq nnmail-split-fancy
      '(| (: nnmail-split-fancy-with-parent)
          (from           mail                                       "INBOX")
          ("sender"       "owner-advanced-sl@multimanpublishing.com" "ASL")
          ("sender"       "cygwin-announce-owner@cygwin.com"         "Cygwin")
          ("sender"       "xemacs-announce-admin@xemacs.org"         "xemacs")
          ("mailing-list" "perl.org"                                 "perl")
          (to             "all.personnel@list.jpl.nasa.gov"          "NASA")
          ("mailing-list" "swish"                                    "swish")
          ("content-type" "text/html\\|big5\\|gb2312\\|ks_c_.*"      "Junk")
          ("subject"      ".*[1²°¶÷].*\\|   [0-9A-Z]\\|panties"      "Junk")
          ("subject"      "earn"                                     "Junk")
          ("message-id"   "tw"                                       "Junk")
          (from           "jpl.nasa.gov"                             "NASA")
          (from           "raytheon.com"                             "Raytheon")
          ("precedence"   "bulk"                                     "Junk")
          (to             "Ericson\\|jlericson"                      "INBOX")
          (to             "jlericson@yahoo.com"                   "INBOX")
;          ("x-mindspring-loop" "jlericson@yahoo.com"              "INBOX")
          "Junk"))
</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first line sorts mail from people I know using <em><a
      href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">Insidious Big Brother
      Database</a></em>.  It's basically an address book that links
      with <a href="http://www.gnus.org">Gnus</a> (the News/Mail
      reader for Emacs).  <br/> <br/>
<code>
(setq nnmail-split-methods 'bbdb/gnus-split-method)
</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I sort mailing lists:
      <br/>
      <br/>
<code>
(setq nnmail-split-fancy
      '(| (: nnmail-split-fancy-with-parent)
          (from           mail                                       "INBOX")
          ("sender"       "owner-advanced-sl@multimanpublishing.com" "ASL")
          ("sender"       "cygwin-announce-owner@cygwin.com"         "Cygwin")
          ("sender"       "xemacs-announce-admin@xemacs.org"         "xemacs")
          ("mailing-list" "perl.org"                                 "perl")
          (to             "all.personnel@list.jpl.nasa.gov"          "NASA")
          ("mailing-list" "swish"                                    "swish")
</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, get rid of likely spam:
      <br/>
      <br/>
<code>
          ("content-type" "text/html\\|big5\\|gb2312\\|ks_c_.*"      "Junk")
          ("subject"      ".*[1²°¶÷].*\\|   [0-9A-Z]\\|panties"      "Junk")
          ("subject"      "earn"                                     "Junk")
          ("message-id"   "tw"                                       "Junk")
          (from           "jpl.nasa.gov"                             "NASA")
          (from           "raytheon.com"                             "Raytheon")
          ("precedence"   "bulk"                                     "Junk")

          (to             "Ericson\\|jlericson"                      "INBOX")
          (to             "jlericson@yahoo.com"                   "INBOX")
;          ("x-mindspring-loop" "jlericson@yahoo.com"              "INBOX")
          "Junk"))
</code>
