      I have had a very long week already, and it압 not over yet!
      Here압 what it looked like...
    </p>s
    <p>
      Saturday: My team had its very first <a
      href="image/payasayo.jpg">clown show</a> and it went amazingly
      well.  Our leaders said it was the best first clown show they
      had ever seen.  We went up and down abandoned railroad tracks
      inviting the children of squatter families (who live in
      thrown-together houses on someone else압 land) to go to the park
      and watch the show.  Many came, and there were also tons of
      other people already hanging out because that압 what people do
      on Saturday afternoons.  We could barely yell over the traffic
      and other random noise, but people heard about Jesus and we gave
      out about a hundred bracelets after the show that use colors to
      explain the Gospel.  And I started losing my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday: Our baby brother was presented to the congregation at
      church and after the service there was a huge party for both the
      boys since the older one just turned 7.  I felt a little more
      sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday: I surprised Jon with a picnic lunch before we went
      shopping at an artisan market called the Ciudadela.  It was a
      fun, relaxing day, but I was really tired.  I discovered later
      that this is because I was getting sick again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday: We had more than double the previous number of students
      in our ESL class, shocking both April and I.  I had incorporated
      Third Day압 "Love Song" into the plan for that day, so I got to
      tell all sorts of random people who might have never been to
      church before that Jesus loves them and died on the cross just
      to save them and be with them forever in Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday: I was really sick by this point.  I ditched Spanish
      class and Spearhead meetings to rest.  I barely made it through
      ESL, but we learned a lot about adjectives with opposite
      meanings.  We were back down to our few faithful students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday: I finally started taking Robitussin and getting
      better.  Other than that, just the usual for a Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday: I rested this morning and then went to the Diego Rivera
      museum with some people from Spearhead.  We had all picked this
      museum over the other possibilities because we wanted to see his
      paintings.  We didn앖 see any.  There were a few sketches, but
      the majority of the place was his collection of pre-hispanic
      art.  The building was really neat since he designed it and the
      mosaics on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praises from this week:
    <ul>
      <li>God is continuing to show Himself to be a provider of every
      last little thing I need.</li>

      <li>My roommate April and I are continuing to get really close
      to each other and our family.</li>

      <li>The medicine is working and I앐 getting better.</li>
      
      <li>I got some really good rest.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayer request:
    <ul>
      <li>Continued improvement and maintenance of my health.  I앐 not
      sure why this cold came back after I was well for a week.</li>

      <li>Making the best use of the time I have left.  Half the
      summer is over already!</li>

      <li>Insight and wisdom about what to do when I get back.  The
      only thing I know for sure is that I have to keep taking classes
      to finish my degree, I앏l be in the same fellowship, and still
      dating Jon.  Everything else is up in the air.</li>

      <li>Successful team events (such as workshops, church services,
      clown shows, and sharing the Gospel).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      My head압 getting stuffy again and I앐 out of time so I앏l sign
      off for now and look forward from hearing from you soon!<br>
      Joy&lt;&gt;&lt;
