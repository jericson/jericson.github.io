      I have finally made it to an internet cafe that has service.
      Since time and resources are limited, I plan to send one mass
      email a week rather than saying the same thing to everyone
      multiple times.  If you respond or send an individual email, I
      will reply individually.

      Despite all the craziness of my last day living on Glenrock in
      Westwood, I have arrived safely.  I didn´t think I was going to
      be able to get everything out of my apartment, take it to my
      house, and get to the airport in time on Wednesday, but Jon and
      I made it with time to spare.  Unfortunately I had to leave a
      mess behind for my roommates because we were short on time.
      Sorry, ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am having a wonderful time so far, though I haven´t seen much
      of the city yet.  I live on the third floor above our church
      (where Spearhead also holds its meetings) with <a
      href="image/familia.jpg">April and our Mexican family</a>.
      April is from Bakersfield where she teaches Freshman English at
      South High.  Our family consists of Yolanda and Abraham who have
      been married eight years and their two boys.  <a
      href="image/isaiandme.jpg">Isaí</a> will be seven this Saturday
      and Elí is fourteen months old.  We´re having a lot of fun with
      all of them.  Their "house" is smaller than my apartment on
      Glenrock was and only has one bathroom, but it feels like home
      already.  We read an article about bonding with the culture that
      said when people try to bond quickly with the culture they´re
      less likely to experience culture shock and homesickness, and I
      think this is the case for me.

      We will be teaching free ESL classes three or four nights a week
      at our church but we haven{t yet worked out all the details with
      our pastor.  Also we will probably be helping with many
      miscellaneous things because we live so close to all the action
      and don´t have to travel.  The Spearhead office is two blocks
      west, and the post office, park, grocery store, and
      all-important paleteria (ice cream shop) are two blocks in the
      other direction.
    </p>

      Our church is a spawn of Grace Community Church which many of
      you from LA should be familiar with (it is pastored by John
      MacArthur of the well-known study Bible).  They sing nothing but
      hymns on Sundays, but they clap sometimes--must be the Latin
      influence.

      Theresa, one of my team leaders, was one of my teammates when I
      was here two years ago, so that´s a blessing.  Since the leaders
      made sure to put Jon on another team, all of my teammates are
      new to me.  I think we´re going to get along well and it´s great
      to have four guys and six girls rather than the 20-80 split we
      had last time.  I feel surprisingly close to many people already
      even though it´s only been a few days since I arrived.  The
      group seems so much more energetic and on-fire than last time,
      hopefully not just because it´s the first week.
    </p>

      We haven´t done much yet, so rather than boring you with too
      many more details, I´ll get to the prayer requests.<br>

      Please pray:
    <ul>
      <li>that April and I will continue to become close and have a
      mutually encouraging relationship.</li>

      <li>for guidance as to the details of the ESL classes (when to
      offer them, what to teach, how to advertise them, etc)</li>

      <li>for a continued attitude of servanthood, especially toward
      April and our family.</li>

      <li>that Jon and I would continue to maintain a healthy
      relationship with the limited time we see each other.  He lives
      on the other side of the city (over an hour away) and Spearhead
      keeps our calendars full with activities.  Fortunately, twice a
      week the entire Spearhead group meets at my church for
      devotionals, worship, and training.</li>

      <li>health and rest.  I have a sinus infection or something
      right now, but I´m already getting better.</li>

      <li>that I will have open eyes and heart to see the work God
      would have me do and the lessons He would have me learn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      ¡Dios le bendiga!<br>
