    <h2>Snapping pictures</h2> 
    <p>
      I bought Joy a <a
      href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/1997-/data/1999_eos-kiss3.html">
      Canon Rebel 2000</a> for Christmas, 2001 and the camera shop
      threw in a <a
      href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/1997-/data/1998_bf35d.html">
      Canon Snappy LXII</a> free (a <a
      href="http://www.belaircamera.com/product.asp?pf_id=snappyII&dept_id=">$59.95
      value</a>).  Naturally, she uses the Rebel all the time and the
      Snappy sat in a drawer.  Rather then let it gather dust, I
      decided to take it to work and record some of the amazing
      sunsets I see almost everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snappy is extremely simple&mdash;no zoom, no auto-focus, no tiny
      buttons&mdash;just a big dial to choose one of: red-eye
      reduction/auto-flash, flash on, flash off, timer, and, of
      course, off.  One problem with the unified control, however is
      that you are stuck with the modes Canon picked.  It would be
      nice to have a timer mode that didn't use the flash, for
      instance.  On the other hand, since the dial is on the front of
      the camera, it should be easy to trouble-shoot problems when you
      hand the camera to a stranger to take your picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viewfinder is large, clear and centered over the lens, which
      is clearly a major selling point.  You can get a good idea of
      what will be in the picture even when holding the camera at arms
      length.  (This was helpful when I leaned across my desk to put
      the camera right against my window.)  Holding the Snappy reminds
      me of Joy's Rebel in part because of a ridge on the right-hand
      side that sort of simulates the grip of a SLR camera.  The lens
      is also shifted a bit to the left-hand side, so I don't cover it
      with my finger when I hold the camera naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In keeping with the theme of simplicity, ordinary AA batteries
      are used to power the camera, meaning you can get replacements
      anywhere on earth and use rechargeables.  (Be careful, though.
      Rechargeable batteries slowly loose charge over the course of a
      month or two.)  Film loading is a snap (ha ha).  There's a
      mid-role rewind feature, but I don't think I'll ever use it.
      The frame counter is (how shall I put this?) less useful than it
      could be.  It's a little dial with approximate positions marked
      ("S", "1", "4", "8", and so on) that gets rotated every time the
      film is advanced.  If you want to know exactly which frame you
      are on, you'd best keep careful notes of the pictures you've
      shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most cameras, the Snappy is fixed-focus.  Only one plane
      of the photograph is perfectly sharp, and every other point is
      to some degree blurry.  I used these <a
      href="http://www.outsight.com/hyperfocal.html">calculators</a>
      to guess that the Snappy is focused at about 9 feet.  For
      brightly lit situations, the blur is not too bad, but it is very
      noticeable in low-light pictures.  That's because the camera's
      auto-exposure system opens the lens as wide as possible
      (increases the aperture) to capture as much light as it can.
      For this camera, that's f/4.5 or about 7.8mm.  The wider the
      aperture, the smaller the <a
      href="http://photonotes.org/cgi-bin/entry.pl?id=Depthoffield">
      depth of field</a>, and the more blurry objects that are too
      close or too far from the ideal focus point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canon lists the focus range as "1.5 m/4.9 ft. to infinity".  I
      found this in the <a
      href="http://www.camera.canon.com.my/camera_lenses/camera/compact/bf8/specifications.htm">
      Prima BF-8 specifications</a>.  It's the same camera&mdash;it
      just has a different name outside the US.  I love the comment on
      the Intro page: "Taking photographs are more exciting and less
      burdening now, thanks to Canon Prima BF-8. Its compact size
      makes it easier to keep as it does not take up too much of
      storage."
    </p>
    <p>
      35mm is right at the boundary of being considered a wide-angle
      lens, which makes it useful inside and for land and cityscapes.
      It's a good size for the sunsets I was trying to capture because
      you get quite a bit of sky in the frame.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically the Snappy LXII is a step above a disposable camera
      and a step below an autofocus point-and-shoot.  This genre of
      cameras seems to be marketed toward children, but it can be
      useful for anyone who wants a cheap, simple camera.  In the
      right conditions (bright sunlight or close flash photography),
      there's no reason you won't get good looking pictures.
