    <h1 class="title">Agua de Pepino y Limón</h1>

    <h2 class="mexico">Ingredientes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pepino (cucumber)</li>
      <li>Limón (lime)</li>
      <li>Azúcar (sugar)</li>
      <li>Agua (water)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mexico">Direcciones</h2>
    <p>
      Puré a pepino in your blender with a bit of water.  (If you
      don't have a blender, you can't cook Mexican food.)  Pour the
      pepino mush through a strainer to eliminate the pulp, skin and
      large chunks.  Add water.  I estimate one cucumber requires a
      gallon of water.  Stir in enough sugar to make the water sweet.
      Squeeze lime juice into the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mexico, everyone buys limes by the sack because lime is
      squeezed onto <strong>everything</strong>.  If you are ever
      served something you don't like in Mexico, just ask "¿Hay
      limón?" and drown it in lime juice.  No one will be offended and
      you might actually like it that way.  (If it's <em>pancita</em>,
      this technique will <strong>not</strong> work, however.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A lime sqeezer is helpful when you need to juice lots of limes.
      I like to try to balance to tastes of the sugar (sweet), the
      lime (sour) and the cucumber (green).  Be sure to use a clear
      glass so that everyone will think you are a health nut.
