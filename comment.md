Since you took the time to leave a comment, I thought you might like
to know that it likely won't ever show up on the page. That's because
comments are an entirely experimental feature. My gauge for success is:

> If I get a lot of comments, I'll think about making them a permanent part of the site.

However, comments are emailed to my personal account and I keep a copy
in case I ever change my mind about publishing. If you left an email address,
I'll try to respond. 

For the curious, I'm using
[Poole](http://hawksworx.com/blog/adding-a-static-comments-system-to-my-jekyll-build/)
to store comments. If you copy
[my source code](https://github.com/jericson/jericson.github.io/blob/master/_includes/comments.html),
please use your own API key.

And just in case you want to try again:

{% include comments.html %}
