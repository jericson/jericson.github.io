Since you took the time to leave a comment, I thought you might like
to know that it likely won't ever show up on the page. That's because
comments are an entirely experimental feature. My gauge for success is:

> If I get a lot of comments, I'll think about making them permanent.

However, comments are emailed to my personal account and I keep a copy
in case I ever change my mind about publishing. If you left an email,
I'll try to respond. But you might be better off sending me an email
directly.

For the curious, I'm using
[Poole](http://hawksworx.com/blog/adding-a-static-comments-system-to-my-jekyll-build/)
to store comments.
