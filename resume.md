I began my career as a programmer, but I keep finding myself taking on
community roles. In my experience as a volunteer moderator and
professional community manager, I've worked with dozens of communities
ranging from college applicants to car enthusiasts to
hermeneuticians. My job is mostly listening and facilitating
company/community communication. I also bring a unique understanding
of social software, data analysis and scripting to my work.

### College Confidential
**Community & Site Operations Manager**&mdash;_January 2020&ndash;March 2021_

**I evaluated a mature community, proposed next steps (including
migrating to Discourse) and worked with the entire company to revive
[the CC community](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/).** On our
team, I was the community dynamics and software expert. Product
mangers, developers and designers consulted with me about how to
manage the forum software. I also worked with moderators and community
leaders to defuse conflict and create community norms that work for
members and the company at large.

My accomplishments included:
* Organizing [community testing of the beta Discourse
  site](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/please-test-the-future-of-cc-forums/2106274)
  and answering community questions about this major change.
* Editing [updated forum rules](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602).
* Forming [student groups](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-student-groups/3499294) so that our primary audience had their own space on the forums.
* Introduced CC's [refreshed brand](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-ccs-refreshed-brand/3503241).

### Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange
**Community Product Manager**&mdash;_July 2013&ndash;January 2020_

**I helped the hundreds thousands of volunteers who contribute to [176
Q&A communities](https://stackexchange.com/sites#users) remain or
become productive.** Obviously no community team can interact with all
of them, so we identified leaders. I appointed many _pro tempore_
moderators and conducted elections. On chat and meta sites, I guided
users by answering their questions about support, new feature ideas,
bugs, interpersonal interactions and community dynamics.


I've worked on several major projects, including:

* Streamlining our [user support
  system](/tag/support.html).
* [Winter Bash
  2014](https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/12/15/winter-bash-2014/).
* The [2017 Developer
  Survey](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/339532/would-you-like-to-test-the-2017-developer-survey).
* [Stack Overflow
  Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).
* Represented the community on the [Developer Affinity & Growth team](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/351751/meet-team-dag-developer-affinity-growth).
* Wrote [starter questions on Stack Overflow for
  Teams](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/368400/1438).

### JPL/Raytheon
**Technical Lead**&mdash;_June 2001&ndash;August 2013_

**I was part of a team that designed and implemented the Science
Investigator-led Processing System to process [Tropospheric Emission
Spectrometer](https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/) algorithms.**  Since launch in
the summer of 2004, we received a constant stream of data that needed
to be stored on tape, converted into interferograms, spectra, vertical
profiles and, finally, global maps for a variety of atmospheric
properties.  As a result, I managed a high-performance computer system
that produced over a terabyte of data each month.

**Systems Engineer**&mdash;_June 1999&ndash;April 2001_

**During the [Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission
"SRTM"), I was part of the ground support team.**  Both before and after
the mission, I helped design and test the software which formatted the
radar data to produce 3-dimensional maps of the Earth's surface.
During the mission, I monitored communication with the astronauts and
waited for downloaded samples of instrument data, which was quickly
processed in order to provide images for the press.  I was responsible
for the demux step.  I also designed a simple report to help my
colleagues anticipate the next downlink slot.

### National Weather Service/Hughes
**Programmer**&mdash;_Summers 1994&ndash;1997_

**As a summer intern, I was asked to code an algorithm that converted
one-minute sensor output into hourly reports of cloud heights and
coverage for the [Automated Surface Observing
System](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/ "ASOS").**  Over the course of the
next three summers I took on algorithm development, design and coding
for serial devices, configuration management, weather observation, and
database management.

### UCLA
**Atmospherics Sciences**&mdash;_May 1999_

One of my favorite classes required me to learn FORTRAN in order to
build atmospheric models. An math class introduced me to
Mathematica. I learned the SPSS statistics software from a cultural
anthropology class. As much as possible, I took history and philosophy
electives. This is when I entered the world of online communities via
Usenet.
