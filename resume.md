Complicated systems fascinate me. Perhaps that's why I was drawn to
programming. In college I studied non-deterministic atmospheric
models. I operated a supercomputer cluster before computation
became a commodity. But since nothing compares in complexity to humans
interacting with each other, I now plan, build and manage online communities.

### Civitas 
**Founder** | June 2021&ndash;Present

**Using my experience as a community manager and a programmer, I help
clients get the most out of their community software.** While working
at EnterpriseDB, I created a part-time community consulting company so
that my community management skills wouldn't get rusty. I now work
full-time with clients using Discourse, the best forum software
around.

* I imported 2.4 million posts from the [Bullshido
  archive](https://forums.bullshido.net/) from a MySQL database to the
  active Discourse forum. Along the way, I contributed changes that
  handled various data problems to the open source import script.
* [Rebel Capitalist forum](https://forum.georgegammon.com/) needed to
  send emails to subscribers who wanted to get investment advice right
  to their inbox. While configuring that, I discovered a problem with
  their MemberPress subscription service and provided a solution.
* Evans Mechanical Services Inc needs a contact form that works well
  on mobile devices and sends emails to employees when a new contact
  is submitted. I built [a Discourse
  plugin](https://github.com/jericson/discourse-contact-plugin) that
  does just that. 
* College Confidential is setting up a premium membership model to
  help pay hosting costs and I'm managing the implementation.


### College Confidential
**Head of Community** | June 2022&ndash;November 2023

**I returned to College Confidential in order to unlock the potential
of the community for a new owner.** The theme for this stretch was
_stabilization_. With several changes in ownership, College
Confidential felt the effects of changes in strategy. My work was both
social and technical.

* Community analysis such as "[How does mandatory registration impact
  participation?](https://jlericson.com/2022/10/14/registration_drives.html)"
  I also wrote SQL queries to keep track of metrics  and updated our
  reporting to GA4.
* [Managed a major database update for the forum
  software](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/maintenance-scheduled-for-friday-september-30/3619753).
* [Set up College Confidential's first moderator
  elections](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/moderator-nominations-for-fall-of-2022/3617796).
* [Created a private forum for
  politics](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/politics-discussion-group/3617248).
* [Hosted and produced episodes of the Admitted
  podcast](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/tag/podcast).
* Brought on Sorin Istrate to replace me as [Head of Community at
  College
  Confidential](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-cc-s-new-head-of-community-cc-sorin/3650152/1).


### EnterpriseDB
**Developer Advocate** | April 2021&ndash;June 2022

**I worked with the documentation team to help them produce excellent
documentation in order to give people confidence they will be
successful.** For many developers deciding on which software to
recommend for purchase, online documentation is the first place they
check. Too many companies ignore the value of documentation for
marketing and lead generation.

* [Documented a strategy for community contributions to EDB documentation](https://jlericson.com/2022/04/04/docs2_contribution.html)
* [Moved binary files to LFS to speed up Git operations.](https://jlericson.com/2021/08/24/git_rewrite_1.html)
* [Built a process to allow the documentation team do daily builds.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/releases)
* [Automated integration of documentation from other projects' repositories.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/blob/2991c889aacf76146a5361e7d24b4359e6f70b65/.github/workflows/sync-and-process-files.yml)
* [Oracle compatibility demo.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility/)
* [BigAnimal quickstart guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/release/free_trial/quickstart/)
* [Installation guide template system.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/tree/3da9047d667d2c560c10e473dc5ec296e185e5ef/install_template)

### College Confidential
**Community & Site Operations Manager** | January 2020&ndash;March 2021

**I evaluated a mature community, proposed next steps (including
migrating to Discourse) and worked with the entire company to revive
[the CC community](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/).** I became
the community dynamics and software expert for the company. Product
managers, developers and designers consulted with me about how to
manage the forum software. In addition, I managed a small team of
community specialists. 

Among my accomplishments:

* Organized [community testing of the beta Discourse
  site](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/please-test-the-future-of-cc-forums/2106274)
  and answering community questions about this major change.
* Edited [updated forum rules](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602).
* Formed [student groups](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-student-groups/3499294) so that our primary audience had their own space on the forums.
* Introduced CC's [refreshed brand](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-ccs-refreshed-brand/3503241).

### Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange
**Community Product Manager** | July 2013&ndash;January 2020

**I learned how to cultivate diverse communities and mentor community
leaders.** With [176 Q&A
sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites#users), Stack Exchange was a
perfect laboratory for understanding how online communities thrive or
decay. Even though I had "manager" in my title, the work was more like
planning and tending a garden. It required both strategic vision for
the entire network and tactical execution for mentoring, mediation, and
communicating change.


I worked on several major projects, including:

* Streamlined our [user support
  system](/tag/support.html).
* [Winter Bash
  2014](https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/12/15/winter-bash-2014/).
* The [2017 Developer
  Survey](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/339532/would-you-like-to-test-the-2017-developer-survey).
* [Stack Overflow
  Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).
* Represented the community on the [Developer Affinity & Growth team](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/351751/meet-team-dag-developer-affinity-growth).
* Wrote [starter questions on Stack Overflow for
  Teams](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/368400/1438).

### JPL/Raytheon
**Technical Lead** | June 2001&ndash;August 2013

**I was part of a team that designed and implemented the Science
Investigator-led Processing System to process [Tropospheric Emission
Spectrometer](https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/) algorithms.**  From launch in
the summer of 2004 through its end of life in 2018, the ground data
system received a constant stream of data that needed to be stored on
tape, converted into interferograms, spectra, vertical profiles and,
finally, global maps for a variety of atmospheric properties.  As a
result, I managed a high-performance computer system that produced
more than a terabyte of data each month.

**Systems Engineer** | June 1999&ndash;April 2001

**During the [Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission
"SRTM"), I was part of the ground support team.**  Both before and after
the mission, I helped design and test the software that formatted the
radar data to produce 3-dimensional maps of the Earth's surface.
During the mission, I monitored communication with the astronauts and
waited for downloaded samples of instrument data, which was quickly
processed in order to provide images for the press.  I was responsible
for the demux step.  I also designed a simple report to help my
colleagues anticipate the next downlink slot.

### National Weather Service/Hughes
**Programmer** | Summers 1994&ndash;1997

**As a summer intern, I was asked to code an algorithm that converted
one-minute sensor output into hourly reports of cloud heights and
coverage for the [Automated Surface Observing
System](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/ "ASOS").**  Over the course of the
next three summers I took on algorithm development, design and coding
for serial devices, configuration management, weather observation, and
database management.

### UCLA
**Atmospherics Sciences** | May 1999

One of my favorite classes required me to learn FORTRAN in order to
build atmospheric models. A math class introduced me to
Mathematica. I learned the SPSS statistics software from a cultural
anthropology class. As much as possible, I took history and philosophy
electives. This is also when I entered the world of online communities via
Usenet.
