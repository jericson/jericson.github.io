Complicated systems fascinate me. Perhaps that's why I was drawn to
programming. In college I studied non-deterministic atmospheric
models. I operated a supercomputer cluster before computation
became a commodity. But since nothing compares in complexity to humans
interacting with each other, I now plan, build and manage online communities.

### College Confidential
**Head of Community** | June 2022&ndash;Present

### EDB
**Developer Advocate** | April 2021&ndash;June 2022

**I worked with the documentation team to help them produce excellent
documentation in order to give people confidence they will be
succesful.**

* [Moving binary files to LFS to speed up Git operations.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/issues/1673)
* [Helping the documentation team do daily builds.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/releases)
* [Automate integration of documentation from other projects' repositories.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/blob/develop/.github/workflows/sync-and-process-files.yml)
* [Oracle compatibility demo.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility/)
* [BigAnimal quickstart guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/release/free_trial/quickstart/)
* [Installation guide template system.](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/tree/develop/install_template)

### College Confidential
**Community & Site Operations Manager** | January 2020&ndash;March 2021

**I evaluated a mature community, proposed next steps (including
migrating to Discourse) and worked with the entire company to revive
[the CC community](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/).** I became
the community dynamics and software expert for the company. Product
managers, developers and designers consulted with me about how to
manage the forum software. In addition, I managed a small team of
community specialists. 

Among my accomplishments:

* Organized [community testing of the beta Discourse
  site](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/please-test-the-future-of-cc-forums/2106274)
  and answering community questions about this major change.
* Edited [updated forum rules](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/forum-rules-update-march-2021/3506602).
* Formed [student groups](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-student-groups/3499294) so that our primary audience had their own space on the forums.
* Introduced CC's [refreshed brand](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/introducing-ccs-refreshed-brand/3503241).

### Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange
**Community Product Manager** | July 2013&ndash;January 2020

**I learned how to cultivate diverse communities and mentor community
leaders.** With [176 Q&A
sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites#users), Stack Exchange was a
perfect laboratory for understanding how online communities thrive or
decay. Even though I had "manager" in my title, the work was more like
planning and tending a garden. It required both strategic vision for
the entire network and tactical execution for mentoring, mediation, and
communicating change.


I worked on several major projects, including:

* Streamlined our [user support
  system](/tag/support.html).
* [Winter Bash
  2014](https://stackoverflow.blog/2014/12/15/winter-bash-2014/).
* The [2017 Developer
  Survey](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/339532/would-you-like-to-test-the-2017-developer-survey).
* [Stack Overflow
  Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation).
* Represented the community on the [Developer Affinity & Growth team](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/351751/meet-team-dag-developer-affinity-growth).
* Wrote [starter questions on Stack Overflow for
  Teams](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/368400/1438).

### JPL/Raytheon
**Technical Lead** | June 2001&ndash;August 2013

**I was part of a team that designed and implemented the Science
Investigator-led Processing System to process [Tropospheric Emission
Spectrometer](https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/) algorithms.**  From launch in
the summer of 2004 through its end of life in 2018, the ground data
system received a constant stream of data that needed to be stored on
tape, converted into interferograms, spectra, vertical profiles and,
finally, global maps for a variety of atmospheric properties.  As a
result, I managed a high-performance computer system that produced
more than a terabyte of data each month.

**Systems Engineer** | June 1999&ndash;April 2001

**During the [Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission
"SRTM"), I was part of the ground support team.**  Both before and after
the mission, I helped design and test the software that formatted the
radar data to produce 3-dimensional maps of the Earth's surface.
During the mission, I monitored communication with the astronauts and
waited for downloaded samples of instrument data, which was quickly
processed in order to provide images for the press.  I was responsible
for the demux step.  I also designed a simple report to help my
colleagues anticipate the next downlink slot.

### National Weather Service/Hughes
**Programmer** | Summers 1994&ndash;1997

**As a summer intern, I was asked to code an algorithm that converted
one-minute sensor output into hourly reports of cloud heights and
coverage for the [Automated Surface Observing
System](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/ "ASOS").**  Over the course of the
next three summers I took on algorithm development, design and coding
for serial devices, configuration management, weather observation, and
database management.

### UCLA
**Atmospherics Sciences** | May 1999

One of my favorite classes required me to learn FORTRAN in order to
build atmospheric models. A math class introduced me to
Mathematica. I learned the SPSS statistics software from a cultural
anthropology class. As much as possible, I took history and philosophy
electives. This is also when I entered the world of online communities via
Usenet.
