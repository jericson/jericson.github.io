## Layout additions

So far my layout is pretty basic. But I have added the following:

* Posts and pages may now have a `subtitle` attribute for alternate or
  extended titles.

* Comments (powered by [Poole](http://pooleapp.com/)) can be turned by
  adding `comments: yes` to the front matter of posts and
  pages. For more information, see <http://jericson.github.io/comment.html>.
