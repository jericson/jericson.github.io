## Layout additions

So far my layout is pretty basic. But I have added the following:

* Posts and pages may now have a `subtitle` attribute for alternate or
  extended titles.

* Comments (powered by [Poole](http://pooleapp.com/)) can be turned by
  adding `comments: yes` to the front matter of posts and
  pages. For more information, see <http://jericson.github.io/comment.html>.

## Licence clarification

Any code I write is currently licenced under the Artistic
License. (But that's not set in stone. If you'd like me to release
under a different license for some reason, just ask.)

I retain copyright on my own content (essentially everything not under
`_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, or `css`) with the exception of
posts that were originally published on Stack Exchange. Those are
licensed under
[CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). For
simplicity's sake, I will probably settle on putting everything under
Creative Commons at some point. But not today.
